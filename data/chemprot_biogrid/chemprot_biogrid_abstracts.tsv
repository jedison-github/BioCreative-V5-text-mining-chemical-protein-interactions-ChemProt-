10025684	Comparable changes in synaptic dopamine induced by methylphenidate and by cocaine in the baboon brain.	Though the blockade of dopamine transporters (DAT) is associated with cocaine's and methylphenidate's reinforcing effects, it is the stimulation of dopamine (DA) receptors, achieved by increases in synaptic DA, that enables these effects to occur. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]raclopride were used to assess the levels of occupancy of DA D2 receptors by dopamine achieved by doses of cocaine or methylphenidate previously documented to block over 70% of DAT. Studies were performed in five baboons using a paired scan protocol designed to measure DA D2 receptor availability (Bmax/Kd) at baseline conditions and after intravenous administration of either cocaine or methylphenidate. Cocaine (1-2 mg/kg) or methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) administered 5 min prior to [11C]raclopride decreased Bmax/Kd by 29+/-3% and 32 + 4%, respectively. Smaller reductions in Bmax/Kd (13% for cocaine given 30 min before [11C]raclopride and 25+/-10% for methylphenidate given 40 min before [11C]raclopride) were seen with longer periods between drug and radioligand. These observations are consistent with the slower striatal clearance kinetics of [11C]methylphenidate than [1C]cocaine observed in previous PET experiments and with the approximately twofold higher potency of methylphenidate than cocaine in in vitro experiments. Though the elevation of synaptic DA induced by >70% occupancy of DAT by these drugs lead to a modest increase in occupancy of D2 receptors (25-30%), further studies are required to assess if this is an underestimation because of differences in D2 receptor binding kinetics between raclopride and DA.
10027835	Inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A, but not type B, is an effective means of inducing anticonvulsant activity in the kindling model of epilepsy.	The anticonvulsant activity of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) was reported early after the development of irreversible MAO inhibitors such as tranylcypromine, but was never clinically used because of the adverse effects of these compounds. The more recently developed reversible MAO inhibitors with selectivity for either the MAO-A or MAO-B isoenzyme forms have not been studied extensively in animal models of epilepsy, so it is not known which type of MAO inhibitor is particularly effective in this respect. We compared the following drugs in the kindling model of epilepsy: 1) L-deprenyl (selegiline), i.e., an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, which, however, also inhibits MAO-A at higher doses, 2) the novel reversible MAO-B inhibitor LU 53439 (3,4-dimethyl-7-(2-isopropyl-1,3, 4-thiadiazol-5-yl)-methoxy-coumarin), which is much more selective for MAO-B than L-deprenyl, 3) the novel reversible and highly selective MAO-A inhibitor LU 43839 (esuprone; 7-hydroxy-3, 4-dimethylcoumarin ethanesulfonate), and 4) the irreversible nonselective MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine. Esuprone proved to be an effective anticonvulsant in the kindling model with a similar potency as L-deprenyl. In contrast to esuprone and L-deprenyl, the selective MAO-B inhibitor LU 53439 was not effective in the kindling model; this substantiates the previous notion that the anticonvulsant activity of L-deprenyl is not related to MAO-B inhibition, but to other effects of this drug, such as inhibition of MAO-A. Drugs inhibiting both MAO-A and MAO-B to a similar extent (tranylcypromine) or combinations of selective MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors (esuprone plus LU 53439) had no advantage over MAO-A inhibition alone, but were less well tolerated. The data thus suggest that selective MAO-A inhibitors such as esuprone may be an interesting new approach for the treatment of epilepsy.
10027842	Intestinal prokinesia by two esters of 4-amino-5-chloro-2- methoxybenzoic acid: involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptors and dissociation from cardiac effects in vivo.	In five fasting, conscious dogs, we compared the prokinetic action of two selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT4) receptor agonists with low affinity for 5-HT3 receptors ML10302 (2-piperidinoethyl 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate) and SR59768 (2-[(3S)-3-hydroxypiperidino]ethyl 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate) in the duodenum and jejunum, using cisapride as a reference compound. Heart rate and rate-corrected QT (QTc) also were monitored to assess whether or not the cardiac effects of cisapride are shared by other 5-HT4 receptor agonists. Both ML10302 and SR59768 dose-dependently stimulated spike activity in the duodenum with similar potencies (dose range, 3-300 nmol/kg i.v.; ED50 values: 24 and 23 nmol/kg i.v., respectively), mimicking the effect of cisapride (30-3000 nmol/kg i.v.). The maximal effect was achieved with the dose of 100 nmol/kg i.v. for both compounds. Similar findings were obtained in the jejunum. Atropine and GR125487 (1-[2-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl-methyl 5-fluoro-2-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxylate, selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist), at doses having no effect per se, antagonized intestinal prokinesia by maximal doses of ML10302 and SR59768. Neither ML10302 nor SR59768 had any effect on heart rate or QTc at any of the doses tested, whereas cisapride, at the highest dose (3000 nmol/kg), induced tachycardia and lengthened the QTC (p <.01). In conclusion, ML10302 and SR59768 share with cisapride a similar prokinetic action in the canine duodenum and jejunum in vivo. This effect is mediated by pathways involving activation of 5-HT4 and muscarinic receptors. Unlike cisapride, which induces tachycardia and prolongs the QTc by a mechanism probably unrelated to 5-HT4 receptor activation, ML10302 and SR59768 are devoid of cardiac effects in this model.
10027850	Selective antiaggressive effects of alnespirone in resident-intruder test are mediated via 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors: A comparative pharmacological study with 8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin, ipsapirone, buspirone, eltoprazine, and WAY-100635.	The present study characterized the effects of the novel, selective, and potent 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (serotonin) (5-HT1A) receptor agonist, alnespirone [S-20499, (S)-N-4-[5-methoxychroman-3-yl)propylamino)butyl- 8-azaspiro-(4,5)-diacetamide, hydrochloride] on offensive and defensive resident-intruder aggression in wild-type rats and compared its actions with those of the prototypical full 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2- dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the partial 5-HT1A agonists ipsapirone and buspirone, and the mixed 5-HT1A/1B agonist eltoprazine. All five agonists exerted effective dose-dependent decreases of offensive aggressive behavior in resident rats; 8-OH-DPAT was the most potent (ID50 = 0.074 mg/kg), followed by eltoprazine (0.24), buspirone (0.72), ipsapirone (1.08), and alnespirone (1.24). However, in terms of selectivity of the antiaggressive effects as determined by the absence of decrements in social interest and general motor activity, alnespirone appeared to be superior. In the defensive aggression test, neither alnespirone nor any of the other four agonists changed defensive behaviors in the intruder rats. The involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was confirmed by showing that the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2- pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride), which was inactive alone, fully prevented the antiaggressive effects of alnespirone, 8-OH-DPAT, and buspirone and partly reversed those of ipsapirone and eltoprazine. The data clearly indicate that alnespirone effectively suppresses offensive aggression with an advantageous profile of action compared with other full or partial 5-HT1A agonists. These selective antiaggressive actions of alnespirone are mediated by stimulating 5-HT1A receptors, presumably the somatodendritic autoreceptors at the raphe nuclei. Furthermore, the data provide evidence for a major involvement of these 5-HT1A receptors in the modulation of aggressive behavior by 8-OH-DPAT, ipsapirone, buspirone, and eltoprazine.
10028924	Modulation of HERG potassium channels by extracellular magnesium and quinidine.	Torsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia resulting from congenital or drug-induced (acquired) QT prolongation. Pharmacologic suppression of repolarizing potassium currents is one mechanism causing the acquired long QT (LQT) syndrome. Recent studies have linked mutations in a gene encoding a potassium channel subunit (HERG) to the LQT syndrome. Clinical experience indicates that intravenous magnesium sulfate is effective in reversing torsades de pointes, but the molecular basis of this effect is not understood. This study was designed to investigate the effects of extracellular magnesium (Mg2+) on HERG potassium currents. HERG potassium channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in a human cell line and were examined by voltage-clamp methods. Extracellular Mg2+ (0.3-10 mM) caused a concentration-dependent shift in the membrane-potential dependence of HERG channel opening, causing a reduction in K+ current. This effect was much greater than that observed in another human delayed rectifier K+ channel, hKv1.5, suggesting a specific interaction with the HERG channel. Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug that also causes torsades de pointes under certain conditions. Quinidine (3 microM) inhibited HERG currents expressed in oocytes by 32.1 +/- 3.2% (n = 5), whereas 1 microM quinidine inhibited HERG currents in tsA201 cells by 75.8 +/- 2.4% (n = 12). Increasing extracellular Mg2+ did not relieve the inhibition by quinidine, but caused additional suppression. These results indicate that extracellular Mg2+ exerts a direct action on HERG potassium channels, resulting in suppression of outward repolarizing potassium current. It is concluded that modulation of this important K+ current is not the mechanism by which intravenous magnesium terminates drug-induced LQT and torsades de pointes. Potent suppression of HERG channel current by quinidine, compared with that of I(Ks) and I(Na), is a likely contributor to torsades de pointes arrhythmias.
10037500	Effects of methylphenidate analogues on phenethylamine substrates for the striatal dopamine transporter: potential as amphetamine antagonists?	Methylphenidate (MPD) was found to inhibit competitively the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and bind at sites on the DAT in common with both cocaine (a non-substrate site ligand) and amphetamine (a substrate site ligand). Some methylphenidate analogues modified on the aromatic ring and/or at the nitrogen were tested to determine whether the profile of inhibition could be altered. None was found to stimulate the release of dopamine in the time frame (< or = 60 s) of the experiments conducted, and each of the analogues tested was found to noncompetitively inhibit the transport of dopamine. It was found that halogenating the aromatic ring with chlorine (threo-3,4-dichloromethylphenidate hydrochloride; compound 1) increased the affinity of MPD to inhibit the transport of dopamine. A derivative of MPD with simultaneous, single methyl group substitutions on the phenyl ring and at the nitrogen (threo-N-methyl-4-methylphenidate hydrochloride; compound 2) bound at a site in common with MPD. A benzyl group positioned at the nitrogen (threo-N-benzylmethylphenidate hydrochloride; compound 3) imparted properties to the inhibitor in which binding at substrate and non-substrate sites could be distinguished. This analogue bound at a mutually interacting site with that of methylphenidate and had a K(int) value of 4.29 microM. Furthermore, the N-substituted analogues (compounds 2 and 3), although clearly inhibitors of dopamine transport, were found to attenuate dramatically the inhibition of dopamine transport by amphetamine, suggesting that the development of an antagonist for substrate analogue drugs of abuse may be possible.
10051426	Three distinct anti-allergic drugs, amlexanox, cromolyn and tranilast, bind to S100A12 and S100A13 of the S100 protein family.	To investigate the roles of calcium-binding proteins in degranulation, we used three anti-allergic drugs, amlexanox, cromolyn and tranilast, which inhibit IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells, as molecular probes in affinity chromatography. All of these drugs, which have different structures but similar function, scarcely bound to calmodulin in bovine lung extract, but bound to the same kinds of calcium-binding proteins, such as the 10-kDa proteins isolated in this study, calcyphosine and annexins I-V. The 10-kDa proteins obtained on three drug-coupled resins and on phenyl-Sepharose were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC. It was found that two characteristic 10-kDa proteins, one polar and one less polar, were bound with all three drugs, although S100A2 (S100L), of the S100 family, was bound with phenyl-Sepharose. The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence proved our major polar protein to be identical with the calcium-binding protein in bovine amniotic fluid (CAAF1, S100A12). The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the less-polar protein shared 95% homology with human and mouse S100A13. In addition, it was demonstrated that the native S100A12 and recombinant S100A12 and S100A13 bind to immobilized amlexanox. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that the three anti-allergic drugs might inhibit degranulation by binding with S100A12 and S100A13.
10052979	Aminopyridazines as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.	Following the discovery of the weak, competitive and reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting activity of minaprine (3c) (IC50 = 85 microM on homogenized rat striatum AChE), a series of 3-amino-6-phenylpyridazines was synthesized and tested for inhibition of AChE. A classical structure-activity relationship exploration suggested that, in comparison to minaprine, the critical elements for high AChE inhibition are as follows: (i) presence of a central pyridazine ring, (ii) necessity of a lipophilic cationic head, (iii) change from a 2- to a 4-5-carbon units distance between the pyridazine ring and the cationic head. Among all the derivatives investigated, 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]-6-phenylpyridazine (3y), which shows an IC50 of 0.12 microM on purified AChE (electric eel), was found to be one of the most potent anti-AChE inhibitors, representing a 5000-fold increase in potency compared to minaprine.1
10064829	Modification of sexual behavior of Long-Evans male rats by drugs acting on the 5-HT1A receptor.	Modulation of the sexual behavior of male rats by the anxiolytic buspirone (S-20499) and its analog gepirone were compared to the effects of 8-OH-DPAT (or DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A reference agonist), and BMY-7378 (a selective 5-HT1A partial agonist). Long-Evans rats were used; modulation of copulatory behavior and alteration of penile reflexes were examined. Modulation of copulatory behavior was assessed by three indices: frequency and length of intromission, and latency of ejaculation. DPAT, at doses of 1-8 mg/kg, reduced these three indices in a time dependent manner such that the effects peaked at 45 min and normalized at 90 min. The dose-effect relationship (assessed 45 min after DPAT injection) is bell-shaped with an ED50 approximately 1 mg/kg on the ascending limb of the curve. The effects of buspirone (2 mg/kg) and gepirone (2 mg/kg) on copulatory behavior were indistinguishable from control. BMY-7378 alone and in combination with these other 5-HT1A agonists reduced copulatory behavior, though not statistically significant. Penile reflexes, including number of erections, cups and flips, were inhibited by these agents: DPAT>buspirone>gepirone (inactive at 2 mg/kg). Furthermore, the latency period to erection was at least doubled by DPAT (2 mg/kg). Buspirone and gepirone, however, reduced the latency period to erection. BMY-7378 inhibited penile reflexes when administered alone and even more in combination with DPAT or buspirone. Two butyrophenone analogs, spiperone (a 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 antagonist) and haloperidol (a D2 antagonist), were also tested for their interaction with DPAT. Both of these drugs (at 0.25 mg/kg, 60 min after administration) reduced all indices of penile reflexes and copulation. Furthermore, in combination with DPAT (2 mg/kg, 45 min), the effects were synergistic such that sexual activity came nearly to a standstill. These opposing effects on putatively brain originated copulatory behavior and spinal mediated penile reflexes indicate that the effects of buspirone and DPAT on sexual behavior in the male rat may be possible at different parts of the central nervous system. If a tentative shared target site by DPAT and buspirone is the 5-HT1A receptor, than the same 5-HT receptor sub-type at different locations (brain, raphe nuclei, spinal cord and autonomic ganglia) may modulate rat sexual behavior in opposing ways.
10067800	Efficacy and safety of telmisartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, compared with enalapril in elderly patients with primary hypertension. TEES Study Group.	To assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the novel AT1 receptor antagonist, telmisartan, compared with that of enalapril in elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
10068594	Intrinsic efficacy of proguanil against falciparum and vivax malaria independent of the metabolite cycloguanil.	Mutations in human CYP2C19 and parasite dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) genes, related to poor metabolism of proguanil and resistance to cycloguanil, respectively, have both been assumed to be associated with poor antimalarial effect by proguanil. To study this, 95 subjects with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax infections in Vanuatu received proguanil treatment for 3 days (adult relative dose of 300-500 mg/day) and were followed up for 28 days. A similarly high antimalarial efficacy against both infections was observed in 62 patients with CYP2C19-related poor metabolizer genotype and in 33 with extensive metabolizer genotype, even though blood cycloguanil was significantly more often detected in those with extensive metabolizer genotype than in those with poor metabolizer genotype. All 28 P. falciparum isolates had two dhfr mutations (residues 59 and 108), suggesting moderate resistance to cycloguanil. The results suggest that the parent compound proguanil has significant intrinsic efficacy against falciparum and vivax malaria independent of the metabolite cycloguanil.
10069682	Comparison of irbesartan with captopril effects on cardiac hypertrophy and gene expression in heart failure-prone male SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proven an effective means to control hypertension and manage cardiac hypertrophy. It is presently unknown if newer specific angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists are as effective or more effective in treating these conditions compared with ACE inhibitors. There is evidence that these classes of drugs may affect cardiac hypertrophy by different mechanisms. This study compared the effect of irbesartan, an AT1R antagonist, with that of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, on expression of early genetic markers of cardiac hypertrophy in lean male SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats. SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats (n = 10/group) were given captopril (100 mg/kg/day), irbesartan (50 mg/kg/day), or placebo for 16 weeks. Irbesartan and captopril significantly reduced systolic pressure and produced similar rightward shifts in the angiotensin I dose-response curve. Renal renin gene expression was increased 8.6-fold by irbesartan and 17.7-fold by captopril. The only effect on echocardiographic findings was a similar decrease in aortic peak velocity, an index of systolic function, by both treatments. Early markers of cardiac hypertrophy were significantly attenuated by both drugs. Both drugs produced marked and equivalent reductions in left ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels compared with controls. This decrease in ANP gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in plasma ANP concentration in the treatment groups. The shift from V1 to V3 myosin isozymes was similarly decreased in both treatment groups, compared with controls. These data suggest that captopril and irbesartan are similarly effective in controlling expression of genes associated with ventricular hypertrophy in heart failure-prone SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rat.
10073743	Vasoconstriction in human isolated middle meningeal arteries: determining the contribution of 5-HT1B- and 5-HT1F-receptor activation.	Sumatriptan is a 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonist which also has affinity for 5-HT1F-receptors. The vasoconstrictor effects of sumatriptan are thought to be 5-HT1B-receptor mediated and these receptors have been shown to be expressed in human cranial blood vessels. However, in the same tissue mRNA coding for 5-HT1F-receptors has also been identified and this study addresses the possibility of whether 5-HT1F-receptor activation contributes to vasoconstriction.
10075051	Effects of epinephrine and amrinone on contractility and cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation of tumor necrosis factor alpha-exposed cardiac myocytes.	This study utilized an in vitro neonatal rat cardiac myocyte assay to evaluate potential differences in the response of TNF-alpha-exposed myocytes to stimulation with the adrenergic agent, epinephrine, and the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, amrinone.
10075381	Comparison of the effects of AT1 receptor blockade and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on atherosclerosis.	Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the development of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic animals across a wide range of species. Although the mechanism for these effects has not been well delineated, it has been assumed generally that both angiotensin II suppression and interference with the breakdown of bradykinin are involved. To determine whether angiotensin II receptor blockade provides similar effects as those observed with ACE inhibition, we examined the influence of irbesartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, on aortic atherosclerosis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits using the identical protocol that was employed in our earlier studies involving ACE inhibitors. At a dose of irbesartan (30 mg/kg/day), which was selected because it appeared to block most of the pressor effects of infused angiotensin in rabbits, no effect on atherosclerosis was observed. However, a higher dose of irbesartan (75 mg/kg/day) caused reductions in blood pressure and aortic atherosclerosis similar to those seen in earlier studies with ACE inhibitors. The decrease in aortic intimal surface involvement with irbesartan was from 38.9 +/- 3.8% in controls to 24.1 +/- 3.0% in the treated group (P < .01). Aortic cholesterol content was also significantly reduced in those animals (P < .02). The findings indicate that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by AT1 receptor blockade in a genetically hypercholesterolemic rabbit model causes comparable inhibition of aortic atherosclerosis as that achieved by ACE inhibition, and that a mild reduction of blood pressure induced by both classes of agents may contribute to their antiatherosclerotic action in this model.
10082805	Effects of cocaine, nicotine, dizocipline and alcohol on mice locomotor activity: cocaine-alcohol cross-sensitization involves upregulation of striatal dopamine transporter binding sites.	We investigated if repeated administration of cocaine, nicotine, dizocipline (MK-801) and alcohol yields behavioral cross-sensitization between these agents. Swiss Webster mice received in their home cage one of the following intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections for 5 consecutive days: (a) saline, (b) cocaine (20 mg/kg), (c) nicotine (0.5 mg/kg), (d) MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg) and (e) ethanol (2.0 g/kg). After a 10-day drug free period, each group (n=30) was divided into three subgroups (n=10) and received challenge injections of either cocaine, nicotine or MK-801. The horizontal and vertical movements of the mice were recorded in locomotor activity cages (test cage). Among the various drugs tested, only the cocaine and ethanol experienced mice developed sensitization to a challenge injection of cocaine; MK-801 pretreated mice showed a sensitized response only to a challenge injection of MK-801. In a second experiment, mice in their home cages received (a) saline, (b) cocaine (20 mg/kg) or (c) ethanol (2.0 g/kg) for 5 days, and challenged with an i.p. ethanol injection (2.0 g/kg) after a 10-day drug free period. Both, cocaine and ethanol experienced mice developed marked sensitization to ethanol challenge compared with the saline experienced mice. Assessment of the densities of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) sites (by [3H]mazindol binding) 11 days after the extinction of repeated treatment with either cocaine or ethanol revealed a significant increase (71-108%) in the number of DAT binding sites. Thus, among the various psychostimulants investigated in the present study cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol was only observed. The behavioral sensitization we measured was primarily 'drug-dependent', rather than 'context-dependent', because animals were exposed to the test cage only once. The finding that cocaine- and ethanol-induced behavioral sensitization is associated with upregulation of striatal DAT binding sites supports the hypothesis that similar neural substrates are involved in the psychomotor/rewarding effects of cocaine and alcohol.
10088139	Sustained antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation combined with pindolol in bipolar depression. A placebo-controlled trial.	Total sleep deprivation (TSD) shows powerful but transient clinical effects in patients affected by bipolar depression. Pindolol blocks the serotonergic 5-HT1A autoreceptor, thus improving the antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. We evaluated the interaction of TSD and pindolol in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar depression. Forty bipolar depressed inpatients were randomized to receive pindolol 7.5 mg/day or placebo for nine days in combination with three consecutive TSD cycles. Pindolol significantly improved the antidepressant effect of TSD, and prevented the short-term relapse after treatment. The response rate (HDRS scores < 8) at the end of treatment was 15/20 for pindolol, and 3/20 for placebo. Coadministration of pindolol and TSD resulted in a complete response, which could be sustained for six months with lithium salts alone, in 65% of cases. This results suggest a major role for serotonergic transmission in the mechanism of action of TSD, and makes TSD treatment more effective in the treatment of bipolar depression.
10091674	Structure-based design of COX-2 selectivity into flurbiprofen.	Comparative computer modeling of the X-ray crystal structures of cyclooxygenase isoforms COX-1 and COX-2 has led to the design of COX-2 selectivity into the nonselective inhibitor flurbiprofen. The COX-2 modeling was based on a postulated binding mode for flurbiprofen and took advantage of a small alcove in the COX-2 active site created by different positions of the Leu384 sidechain between COX-1 and COX-2. The design hypothesis was tested by synthesis and biological assay of a series of flurbiprofen analogs, culminating in the discovery of several inhibitors having up to 78-fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1.
10101238	Magnitude of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1A receptor activation in guinea-pig and rat brain: evidence from sumatriptan dimer-mediated [35S]GTPgammaS binding responses.	The present study reports on G-protein activation by recombinant 5-HT receptors and by native 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in guinea-pig and rat brain using agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding responses mediated by a new 5-HT ligand, a dimer of sumatriptan. Dimerization of sumatriptan increased the binding affinity for h 5-HT1B (pKi: 9.22 vs. 7.79 for sumatriptan), h 5-HT1D (9.07 vs. 8.08) and also h 5-HT1A receptors (7.80 vs. 6.40), while the binding affinity for h 5-ht1E (6.67 vs. 6.19) and h 5-ht1F (7.37 vs. 7.78) receptors was not affected. Sumatriptan dimer (10 microM) stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding mainly in the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculi, hippocampus and substantia nigra of guinea-pig and rat coronal brain sections. This fits with the labelling by the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist [3H] GR 125743. The observed [35S]GTPgammaS binding responses in the substantia nigra are likely to be mediated by stimulation of the 5-HT1B receptor subtype, since they were antagonized by the 5-HT1B inverse agonist SB 224289 (10 microM), and not by the 5-HT2A/1D antagonist ketanserin (10 microM). Quantitative assessment of the [35S]GTPgammaS binding responses in the substantia nigra of rat showed highly efficacious responses for both sumatriptan dimer and its monomer. In contrast, less efficacious agonist responses (51+/-10% and 35+/-13%, respectively) were measured in the guinea-pig substantia nigra. This may suggest that the G-protein coupling efficacy of 5-HT1B receptors is different between the substantia nigra of both species. In addition, the sumatriptan dimer also activated guinea-pig and rat hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors with high efficacy in contrast to sumatriptan. Therefore, dimerization of sumatriptan can be considered as a new approach to transform a partial 5-HT1A agonist into a more efficacious agonist. In conclusion, the sumatriptan dimer stimulates G-protein activation via 5-HT1B receptors besides 5-HT1A receptors in guinea-pig and rat brain. The magnitude of the 5-HT1B receptor responses is superior for sumatriptan and its dimer in rat compared to guinea-pig substantia nigra.
10102370	YAP1 confers resistance to the fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin through the transporter Flr1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	In this study, we utilized a genetic approach to identify genes which render yeast cells resistant to cerulenin (Cer), a potent and noncompetitive inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Overexpression of the yeast transcription factor Yap1p was found to confer Cer resistance (CerR). This resistance was shown to be less pronounced in a strain deleted for YCF1, a multidrug resistance ABC transporter, supporting previous observations that implicated YCF1 in mediating CerR. However, isolation of YAP1 as a high-copy CerR gene in a ycf1delta strain suggested that YAP1-induced CerR was mediated by additional downstream effectors. Overexpression of neither glutathione reductase nor a predicted aryl alcohol dehydrogenase (the products of two YAP1-regulated genes involved in detoxification) conferred CerR. Overexpression of ATR1, another YAP1-regulated gene previously implicated in conferring resistance to a number of cytotoxic drugs, was also incapable of making cells resistant to Cer. In contrast, overexpression of Flr1p, a yeast transporter of the major facilitator superfamily which is also under the control of YAP1, was sufficient to confer CerR in an otherwise wild-type background. Moreover, CerR was markedly diminished in a strain deleted for FLR1. These findings implicate members of both of the transporter superfamilies involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR) in the acquisition of CerR in yeast. Furthermore, our studies indicate that yeast may be a useful model system in which to investigate the role of FAS in cancer biology and the effects of Cer on eukaryotic cell growth.
10103097	Acetylcholinesterase and inhibitors: effects upon normal and regenerating nerves of the rat.	In peripheral nerves, the function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is not related to hydrolysis of acetylcholine. To test for a trophic role, AChE or its inhibitors were administered locally to normal and regenerating nerves of rats. In the normal nerve, neither AChE nor serum albumin affected the cytological pattern of the nerve. BW284c51, a specific inhibitor of AChE, resulted in demyelination, proliferation of Schwann cells and sprouting of axons after 5-7 days. Edrophonium or propidium, other specific inhibitors of AChE, did so to a much lesser extent. Vehicle, and iso-OMPA (inhibitor of pseudocholinesterases) did not affect the cytology of the nerve. Elongation of regenerating axons was evaluated at day 3 post-crush. Native AChE applied distal to the crush reduced the elongation of regenerating axons (- 36%), while serum albumin, heated AChE and filtered AChE did not. BW284c51, edrophonium or propidium enhanced the axonal elongation (33%) when they were administered for 2 days before, but not after, the crush. Iso-OMPA or vehicle administered before or after the crush were not effective. Thus, AChE reduces elongation of regenerating axons, while inhibition of AChE enhances elongation and affects the cytology of the normal nerve as well. We propose that AChE has a trophic role in mammalian peripheral nerves.
10188639	Corticosterone regulation of serotonin transporter and 5-HT1A receptor expression in the aging brain.	Hypercortisolemia is often observed in patients suffering from major depression. As the serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system plays a major role in the etiology of depression, a loss of endocrine and neurotransmitter system interactions, including corticosterone regulation of 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) and 5-HT receptor expression, may underlie age-related deficits in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and correlate with an increased incidence of depression with advancing age. In this study, female Fischer 344 rats, ages 3, 13, and 18 months, were bilaterally adrenalectomized and supplemented for 3 weeks with corticosterone (0, 200, or 600 mg; LC, MC, or HC, respectively) containing 21 day sustained-release pellets implanted subcutaneously. Quantitative autoradiography of hippocampal and cortical regions using [3H]citalopram revealed a significant decrease in hippocampal 5-HTT binding in the 3-month HC treatment group compared to age-matched MC and LC groups; this loss was not present in the 13- or 18-month groups. Similarly, quantitative autoradiography using the radiolabeled 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin demonstrated a significant decline in receptor density in 3- and 13-month MC and HC groups as compared to age-matched LC groups in the hippocampus. These hormone treatments (MC or HC), however, failed to alter hippocampal 5-HT(1A) binding site density in the 18-month groups as compared to the age-matched LC group. The 5-HT(2A) receptor was also evaluated using [3H]ketanserin and showed no age- or corticosterone-related changes in the cortex. Overall, an age-associated deficit in the regulation of the hippocampal serotonergic system by varied corticosterone treatment was revealed in the present study, which may underlie the increased incidence of depression and hypercortisolemia found with advancing age.
10188968	Canine external carotid vasoconstriction to methysergide, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine: role of 5-HT1B/1D receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors.	The antimigraine drugs methysergide, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (DHE) produce selective vasoconstriction in the external carotid bed of vagosympathectomized dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbital and artificially respired, but the receptors involved have not yet been completely characterized. Since the above drugs display affinity for several binding sites, including alpha-adrenoceptors and several 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes, this study has analysed the mechanisms involved in the above responses. Intracarotid (i.c.) infusions during 1 min of methysergide (31-310 microg min(-1)), ergotamine (0.56-5.6 microg min(-1)) or DHE (5.6-31 microg min(-1)) dose-dependently reduced external carotid blood flow (ECBF) by up to 46+/-4, 37+/-4 and 49+/-5%, respectively. Blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. The reductions in ECBF by methysergide were abolished and even reversed to increases in animals pre-treated with GR127935 (10 microg kg(-1), i.v.). The reductions in ECBF by ergotamine and DHE remained unchanged in animals pre-treated (i.v.) with prazosin (300 microg kg(-1)), but were partly antagonized in animals pre-treated with either GR127935 (10 or 30 microg kg(-1)) or yohimbine (1000 microg kg(-1)). Pre-treatment with a combination of GR127935 (30 microg kg(-1)) and yohimbine (1000 microg kg(-1)) abolished the responses to both ergotamine and DHE. The above doses of antagonists were shown to produce selective antagonism at their respective receptors. These results suggest that the external carotid vasoconstrictor responses to methysergide primarily involve 5-HT1B/1D receptors, whereas those to ergotamine and DHE are mediated by 5-HT1B/1D receptors as well as alpha2-adrenoceptors.
10199854	Inhibition of phospholipase A2 attenuates functional hyperemia in the hamster cremaster muscle.	Arachidonic acid (AA) is the common precursor for several vasodilatory factors involved in the local control of blood flow. This study was designed to determine the role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and AA release in functional hyperemia in the hamster cremaster muscle. The muscle was prepared for in vivo microscopy and subjected to electrical field stimulation for 1 min. First- and second-order arterioles dilated in response from a mean diameter of 66 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 7 micrometer (n = 6). PLA2 was then inhibited with quinacrine (3 x 10(-6) M) for 60 min. PLA2 inhibition was verified by an attenuation of thrombin-induced vasodilation (2 U/ml). Quinacrine had no effect on resting arteriolar diameter but completely abolished functional hyperemia. Quinacrine also had no effect on dilation induced by superfusion of the preparation with 3 x 10(-6)-10(-5) M AA, 10(-6)-10(-4) M adenosine, or 10(-6)-10(-4) M sodium nitroprusside, ruling out nonspecific effects of quinacrine on smooth muscle contractility. These results indicate that functional hyperemia in the hamster cremaster muscle is dependent on PLA2 activation and the availability of AA.
10199939	In vivo imaging of serotonin transporters with [99mTc]TRODAT-1 in nonhuman primates.	[99mTc]TRODAT-1 was the first 99mTc-labeled imaging agent to show specific binding to dopamine transporters (DAT) in the striatum (STR) of human brain. Additionally, in vitro binding and autoradiographic experiments demonstrated that this tracer also binds to serotonin transporters (SERT) in the midbrain/hypothalamus (MB) area. In this study, [99mTc]TRODAT-1 was investigated as a potentially useful ligand to image SERT in the MB of living brain. A total of eight single-photon emission tomography (SPET) scans were performed in two baboons (Papio anubis) after intravenous (i.v.) injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 using a triple-head gamma camera equipped with ultra-high-resolution fan-beam collimators (scan time: 0-210 min). In four blocking studies, baboons were pretreated with (+)McN5652 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or methylphenidate (1 mg/kg, i.v.) to specifically block SERT or DAT, respectively. After co-registration with magnetic resonance images of the same baboon, a region of interest analysis was performed using predefined templates to calculate specific uptake in the midbrain area and the striatum, with the cerebellum as the background region [(MB-CB)/CB, (STR-CB)/CB]. Additionally, two PET scans of the same baboons were performed after i.v. injections of 74-111 MBq (2-3 mCi) of [11C](+)McN5652 to identify the SERT sites. In [99mTc]TRODAT-1/SPET scans, the SERT sites in the MB region were clearly visualized. Semiquantitative analysis revealed a specific uptake in MB ([MB-CB]/CB) of 0.30+/-0.02, which was decreased to 0. 040+/-0.005 after pretreatment with nonradioactive (+)McN5652, a selective SERT ligand. Pretreatment with methylphenidate reduced the specific binding of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 to DAT sites [(STR-CB)/CB] from 2.45+/-0.13 to 0.32+/-0.04 without any effect on its binding to SERT sites [(MB-CB)/CB], which was confirmed by the co-registration of the [11C](+)McN5652/PET scans. This preliminary study suggests that specific binding of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 to SERT sites can be detected by in vivo SPET imaging despite the low target to background ratio. These findings provide impetus for further development of similar compounds with improved binding affinity and selectivity to SERT sites.
10208549	Effects of bis(7)-tacrine, a novel anti-Alzheimer's agent, on rat brain AChE.	The anticholinesterase effects of bis(7)-tacrine were compared with tacrine in vitro and in vivo. Based on IC50 ratios, the dimeric analog bis(7)-tacrine was, in a reversible manner, up to 150-fold more potent and 250-fold more selective than tacrine for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) over butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Following a single oral administration, both bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine produced dose-dependent inhibitions of AChE in rat brain, but bis(7)-tacrine exhibited higher efficacy and AChE/BChE selectivity than tacrine. The anti-AChE efficacy of bis(7)-tacrine was quite similar following an oral or i.p. administration, but tacrine showed much lower efficacy when administered orally than when given i.p. These findings suggest bis(7)-tacrine, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of AChE, can probably be used as an improved drug in the palliative treatment of AD.
10210906	In vivo PET study of cerebral [11C] methyl- tetrahydroaminoacridine distribution and kinetics in healthy human subjects.	It is unclear whether the palliative effects of tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) (tacrine, Cognex) on the clinical symptoms of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the result of its inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase or on other complex sites of action. In order to investigate the cerebral distribution and kinetics of THA in the human brain in vivo, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]N-methyl-tetrahydro-aminoacridine (MTHA) in healthy human volunteers. After intravenous injection, [11C]MTHA crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached its maximum uptake between 10 and 40 minutes, depending on the brain regions. Uptake was higher in the grey matter structures, and lower in the white matter. After this peak, the radioactivity remained quasi- constant until 60 minutes in all regions with a half-life varying from 2.44 hours in the thalamus to 3.42 hours in the cerebral cortex. The ratios of regional to whole cerebral cortex brain radioactivity calculated between 50 and 70 minutes after the tracer injection were 1.14 +/- 0.04, 1.07 +/- 0. 03 and 1.06 +/- 0.04 in the putamen, cerebellum and thalamus, respectively. Overall, these results show that: (1) [11C]MTHA crosses the blood-brain barrier easily and is highly concentrated in the brain; (2) the regional brain distribution of [11C]MTHA does not parallel that of in vivo acetylcholinesterase (AChE) concentrations; and (3) the cerebral kinetics of [11C]MTHA are consistent with known plasmatic pharmacokinetics of THA in AD patients. We conclude that PET imaging with [11C]MTHA is a useful method for assessing the cerebral distribution and kinetics of THA in vivo.
10212017	Affinities of brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, and terfenadine at the five human muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes.	Anticholinergic effects are presumed to be the mechanism for the efficacy of chlorpheniramine in symptomatic relief of the common cold. Terfenadine, a second-generation antihistamine, reportedly lacks anticholinergic side effects. We evaluated affinities of two commonly used over-the-counter antihistamines, brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine, as well as terfenadine in comparison with atropine at the five human muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes using CHO cells stably transfected with the individual subtypes. Atropine was more potent than all three drugs at m1-m5 (p<0.01). No significant difference was observed between chlorpheniramine and brompheniramine. Atropine, brompheniramine, and chlorpheniramine could not discriminate between m1-m5. Terfenadine demonstrated subtype selectivity at m3. In vitro comparisons in human muscarinic receptor subtypes could potentially be used to predict clinical anticholinergic effects of antihistamines and to target receptor-specific effects of such agents.
10214942	PPARgamma activators down-regulate the expression of PPARgamma in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	Transcriptional activation of PPARgamma by the anti-diabetic compound troglitazone enhances the rate of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. In this study, we examined the effects of troglitazone, a specific PPARgamma ligand, on the expression of PPARgamma during and after 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Troglitazone treatment caused a significant decrease in PPARgamma proteins and DNA binding activity. This reduction was associated with a similar decrease in transcription of PPARgamma mRNA. These data suggest that in 3T3-L1 cells, the expression of PPARgamma is auto-regulated.
10215667	Subtype-selective antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by felbamate: insights into the mechanism of action.	Felbamate is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and complex partial seizures that are refractory to other medications. Its unique clinical profile is thought to be due to an interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, resulting in decreased excitatory amino acid neurotransmission. To further characterize the interaction between felbamate and NMDA receptors, recombinant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes were used to investigate the subtype specificity and mechanism of action. Felbamate reduced NMDA- and glycine-induced currents most effectively at NMDA receptors composed of NR1 and NR2B subunits (IC50 = 0.93 mM), followed by NR1-2C (2.02 mM) and NR1-2A (8.56 mM) receptors. The NR1-2B-selective interaction was noncompetitive with respect to the coagonists NMDA and glycine and was not dependent on voltage. Felbamate enhanced the affinity of the NR1-2B receptor for the agonist NMDA by 3.5-fold, suggesting a similarity in mechanism to other noncompetitive antagonists such as ifenprodil. However, a point mutation at position 201 (E201R) of the epsilon2 (mouse NR2B) subunit that affects receptor sensitivity to ifenprodil, haloperidol, and protons reduced the affinity of NR1-epsilon2 receptors for felbamate by only 2-fold. Furthermore, pH had no effect on the affinity of NR1-2B receptors for felbamate. We suggest that felbamate interacts with a unique site on the NR2B subunit (or one formed by NR1 plus NR2B) that interacts allosterically with the NMDA/glutamate binding site. These results suggest that the unique clinical profile of felbamate is due in part to an interaction with the NR1-2B subtype of NMDA receptor.
10215901	Pre- or post-training injection of buspirone impaired retention in the inhibitory avoidance task: involvement of amygdala 5-HT1A receptors.	The present study investigated the effect of buspirone on memory formation in an aversive learning task. Male Wistar rats were trained on the inhibitory avoidance task and tested for retention 1 day after training. They received peripheral or intra-amygdala administration of buspirone or other 5-HT1A drugs either before or after training. Results indicated that pretraining systemic injections of buspirone caused a dose-dependent retention deficit; 5. 0 mg/kg had a marked effect and 1.0 mg/kg had no effect. Post-training injections of the drug caused a time-dependent retention deficit, which was not due to a state-dependent effect on retrieval. When training in the inhibitory avoidance task was divided into a context-training phase and a shock-training phase, buspirone impaired retention only when administered in the shock-training phase, suggesting that the drug influenced memory processing of affective events. Further results indicated that post-training intra-amygdala infusion of buspirone or the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-di-n-propylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) caused a time-dependent and dose-dependent retention deficit. Post-training intra-amygdala infusion of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 (N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamine maleate) attenuated the memory-impairing effects of buspirone. These findings suggest that buspirone may modulate memory storage processes in the inhibitory avoidance task through an action on amygdaloid 5-HT1A receptors.
10220944	[Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic aspects of the non-inflammatory non-steroidal agent meloxicam in dogs].	The pharmacodynamics of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are for the most part well-understood. All NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), and for this reason prostaglandin synthesis. Two isoforms of COX could be isolated. COX-1 is detectable in most tissues on a constant level and is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins with cytoprotective effects. COX-2 is induced through inflammation and supports the inflammatory process by producing pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The desired effects of NSAIDs are related to inhibition of COX-2, whereas inhibition of COX-1 has been linked to the typical side-effects of NSAIDs, especially in the stomach and kidney. The great differences between effects and side-effects in the numerous substances can be explained because of different interactions of the NSAIDs on COX-1 and COX-2. In various test systems meloxicam has been shown to be a preferential inhibitor of COX-2. There are also large differences between the individual NSAIDs with regard to pharmacokinetics. Meloxicam is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has an elimination half-life of 24 hours in the dog. It is excreted in faeces and urine. The metabolites, detectable in urine are biologically inactive and do not influence the prostaglandin synthesis in the kidney. In the underlying study, plasma concentration of meloxicam was determined after a subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mg/kg b. w. (day 1) followed by oral treatment of 0.1 mg/kg b. w. (days 2-14). The results confirm the recommended dosage regime of meloxicam with its initial loading dose and the subsequent maintenance dose. This dosing regime results in a very favourable curve of concentrations with a very rapidly attained steady state after roughly two days, without accumulation even in long-term treatment.
10221756	Prevention by 5-HT1A receptor agonists of restraint stress- and yohimbine-induced release of cholecystokinin in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat.	In line with the idea that cholecystokinin (CCK) is involved in anxiety-related behaviours, previous investigations showed that stressful conditions and an 'anxiogenic' drug, yohimbine, increased the cortical release of CCK like-material (CCKLM) in awake rats, and that this effect could be prevented by diazepam. Here, we investigated whether other anxiolytic drugs such as 5-HT1A receptor agonists could also affect cortical CCKLM release. Indeed, neither buspirone (1 mg/kg i.p.), alnespirone (1 mg/kg i.p.) nor lesopitron (3 mg/kg i.p.) affected, on their own, CCKLM release. However, pretreatment with the latter drugs completely abolished the stimulatory effect of restraint stress on the peptide outflow. As expected of the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors, tertatolol (10 mg/kg i.p) markedly reduced the inhibitory effect of buspirone on restraint stress-evoked CCKLM overflow. On the other hand, pretreatment with buspirone, alnespirone or lesopitron also inhibited the stimulatory effect of yohimbine (5 mg/kg i.p.) on cortical CCKLM outflow. These data support the idea that the anxiolytic action of 5-HT1A receptor agonists could be mediated, at least partly, through their inhibitory influence on cortical CCK-ergic systems.
10222233	Prostaglandin J2 and its metabolites promote neurite outgrowth induced by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells.	Although A- and J-type prostaglandins (PG's) arrest the cell cycle at the G1 phase in vitro and suppress tumor growth in vivo, their effects on neuronal cells have not so far been clarified. Here, we found promotion of neurite outgrowth as a novel biological function of PGJ's. In PC12h cells, PGJ's (PGJ2, Delta12-PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2) promoted neurite outgrowth in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), whereas they themselves did not show such a promotion. The potency of promoting neurite outgrowth was PGJ2 < Delta12-PGJ2 < 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2. However, troglitazone, an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPARgamma), and other PG's including PGA1, PGA2 and PGD2 did not promote neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that PGJ's promote neurite outgrowth independently of PPARgamma activation.
10224140	Molecular cloning and characterization of a new multispecific organic anion transporter from rat brain.	A cDNA encoding the new member of the multispecific organic anion transporter family, OAT3, was isolated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction cloning method. Degenerate primers were designed based on the sequences conserved among OAT1, OAT2, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. The 536-amino acid protein sequence encoded by OAT3 showed 49, 39, and 36% identity to those of OAT1, OAT2, and OCT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that rat OAT3 mRNA is expressed in the liver, brain, kidney, and eye. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OAT3 mediated the uptake of organic anions, such as p-aminohippurate (Km = 65 microM), ochratoxin A (Km = 0.74 microM), and estrone sulfate (Km = 2.3 microM) and a cationic compound, cimetidine. OAT3-mediated uptake of [3H]estrone sulfate was sodium-independent. para-Aminohippuric acid, estrone sulfate or ochratoxin A did not show any trans-stimulatory effect on either influx or efflux of [3H]estrone sulfate via OAT3. Organic anions such as sulfobromophthalein, probenecid, indocyanine green, bumetanide, piroxicam, furosemide, azidodeoxythymidine, 4, 4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-3,3'-disulfonic acid, and benzylpenicillin inhibited OAT3-mediated estrone sulfate uptake, while ouabain and digoxin did not. Organic cations such as tetraethylammonium, guanidine, verapamil, and quinidine did not interact with OAT3. Acidic metabolites of neurotransmitters derived from dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin inhibited the uptake of estrone sulfate via OAT3. These results suggest an important role of OAT3 in the excretion/detoxification of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially from the brain.
10227113	Antagonism by olanzapine of dopamine D1, serotonin2, muscarinic, histamine H1 and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in vitro.	The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has relatively high affinity for a number of neuronal receptors in radioreceptor binding assays. The ability of olanzapine to activate or antagonize a number of neuronal receptors was investigated in vitro, in cell lines transfected selectively with receptor subtypes and in receptor-selective isolated tissue studies. Olanzapine had no agonist activity at any of the receptors examined. However, olanzapine was a potent antagonist of 5-HT-stimulated increases in IP3 in cell lines transfected with 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors with IC50 values of 30-40 nM. Olanzapine weakly blocked 5-HT-induced formation of IP3 in cell lines transfected with 5-HT2c receptors, but in this cell line potently inhibited 5-HT-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding with a Ki value of 15 nM. Olanzapine blocked dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in rat retina with modest potency (Ki = 69 nM), consistent with its relatively low affinity for dopamine D1 receptors. Olanzapine blocked agonist-induced activities at the muscarinic receptor subtypes M1, M2, M3, and M5 with Ki values of 70, 622, 126, and 82 nM, respectively. In studies using cell lines transfected with muscarinic M4 receptors, olanzapine and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine did not have agonist activities as determined with cAMP inhibition and stimulation assays, arachidonic acid release and [35S]GTP gamma S binding assays. However, olanzapine antagonized agonist-induced effects in muscarinic M4 cells with a Ki value of 350 nM. In isolated tissue studies, olanzapine potently blocked agonist-induced effects at alpha 1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (KB = 9 and 19 nM, respectively). Thus, olanzapine was an antagonist at all receptors investigated and was a particularly potent antagonist at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, alpha 1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Olanzapine was a weaker antagonist at muscarinic and dopamine D1 receptors.
10229494	Influence of halothane on phospholipase A2 and enzymatic methylations in the rat retinal membranes.	Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipid methylases (PLM) play significant roles in transmitter release and membrane signal transduction, respectively. Previous studies have indicated that PLMs occur in the rat brain synaptosomal and retinal membranes, and they are activated under halothane anesthesia. The influence of halothane on PLA2 is not known. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of halothane on retinal PLA2 activity. Rat retinal sonicates were assayed for PLA2 activity using 1-palmitoyl-2[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 2.2 nmol) in Tris buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C with and without halothane (0.25-2.0 mM) in the assay medium. These studies gave the following results: (1) Rat retinal sonicates contained PLA2 activity of 4.2+/-0.8 pmol PE hydrolyzed/100 ng protein/hr; (2) Halothane (0.25-2.0 mM) increased PLA2 activity by 20 to 150% depending upon concentration; (3) The lower concentration of halothane (0.25 mM) exhibited high activation of PLA2 (150%); (4) High concentrations of halothane (1.0-2.0 mM) caused a low degree of activation of PLA2 (20%); and (5) During phospholipid methylation of retinal membranes with S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the presence of halothane, increased amounts of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were formed. This increase in FAME (45%) was possibly due to the hydrolysis of phospholipids by activated PLA2, liberating fatty acids which were methylated. This increase in FAME (45%) was inhibited by mepacrine (quinacrine) (10 microM), an inhibitor of PLA2. These observations suggest that the release of retinal transmitters (dopamine, acetylcholine and others) is affected during halothane anesthesia, due to activation of PLA2 and enhanced fusogenic activity of vesicular membranes with plasma membrane and depletion of vesicles.
10231134	Is phentermine an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase? A critical appraisal.	Phentermine produces a spectrum of concentration-dependent biochemical effects. It interacts with NE transporters at 0.1 microM, DA transporters at about 1 microM, 5-HT transporters at 15 microM and MAO-A at about 100 microM. When administered at typical anorectic doses, phentermine primarily interacts with DA and NE transporters and does not produce biochemical or neurochemical effects which would occur if it were inhibiting MAO-A. Some other explanation other than MAO inhibition must be sought to explain how oral phentermine increases platelet 5-HT, since platelet MAO-B does not metabolize platelet 5-HT, and since amphetamine-type drugs are even weaker inhibitors of MAO-B than MAO-A. Clinical studies in humans have shown that amphetamine, which is a more potent inhibitor of MAO-A than phentermine, does not inhibit MAO-A at therapeutic doses. Neither phentermine alone, fluoxetine alone or their combined use have been associated with cardiac valvulopathy, and clinical experience has shown their combined use to be free of significant adverse effects. Viewed collectively, there appears to be no data to support the hypothesis that phentermine inhibits MAO at typical therapeutic doses.
10328880	Molecular identification of the human GABABR2: cell surface expression and coupling to adenylyl cyclase in the absence of GABABR1.	We have identified a gene encoding a GABAB receptor, the human GABABR2, located on chromosome 9q22.1, that is distinct from the recently reported rat GABABR1. GABABR2 structurally resembles GABABR1 (35% identity), having seven transmembrane domains and a large extracellular region, but differs in having a longer carboxy-terminal tail. GABABR2 is localized to the cell surface in transfected COS cells, and negatively couples to adenylyl cyclase in response to GABA, baclofen, and 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid in CHO cells lacking GABABR1. Baclofen action is inhibited by the GABABR antagonist, 2-hydroxysaclofen. The human GABABR2 and GABABR1 genes are differentially expressed in the nervous system, with the greatest difference being detected in the striatum in which GABABR1 but not GABABR2 mRNA transcripts are detected. GABABR2 and GABABR1 mRNAs are also coexpressed in various brain regions such as the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. Identification of a functional homomeric GABABR2 coupled to adenylyl cyclase suggests that the complexity of GABAB pharmacological data is at least in part due to the presence of more than one receptor and opens avenues for future research leading to an understanding of metabotropic GABA receptor signal transduction mechanisms.
10328995	Pharmacological properties of a novel gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamide selective for human 5-HT4 receptor versus human 5-HT3 receptor.	Binding properties of gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides for both cloned human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 receptors and cloned human 5-HT4 receptors were examined and pharmacological properties of YM-53389{(+)-(S)-2-chloro-5-methoxy-4-[5-(2-piperidylmethyl)-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl]aniline monohydrochloride} were characterised in animals. Cisapride, renzapride and zacopride inhibited specific binding of [3H]ramosetron to cloned human 5-HT3 receptors, with Ki values of 684, 7.64 and 0.38 n m, respectively. YM-53389, however, slightly replaced that (Ki>10,000 n m). YM-53389, cisapride, renzapride and zacopride replaced specific binding of [3H]GR 113808 to cloned human 5-HT4 receptors, with Ki values of 54.6, 41.5, 115 and 373 n m, respectively. The potency for inhibitory effect of YM-53389 on 5-HT3 receptor-mediated contraction in the guinea-pig isolated colon was very low with pIC50 of 4.7. YM-53389 exerted 5-HT4 receptor-mediated relaxation in the carbachol-precontracted rat isolated oesophagus with pEC50 of 6.3. In mice, YM-53389 at 10 and 30 mg kg-1, s.c. significantly shortened whole gut transit time, in contrast to cisapride, renzapride and zacopride which were reported to delay that. YM-53389 had no significant effect on upper gastrointestinal propulsion at doses up to 30 mg kg-1, s.c. Based on these results, YM-53389 may surpass existing benzamides in facilitating lower intestinal propulsion and benefit patients with gastrointestinal disorders associated with impair of intestinal propulsion, such as constipation, based on the selective interaction with human 5-HT4 receptors vs human 5-HT3 receptors.

10358065	The role of arginine 120 of human prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 in the interaction with fatty acid substrates and inhibitors.	Arg-120 is located near the mouth of the hydrophobic channel that forms the cyclooxygenase active site of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs)-1 and -2. Replacement of Arg-120 of ovine PGHS-1 with a glutamine increases the apparent Km of PGHS-1 for arachidonate by 1,000-fold (Bhattacharyya, D. K., Lecomte, M., Rieke, C. J., Garavito, R. M., and Smith, W. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2179-2184). This and other evidence indicate that the guanido group of Arg-120 forms an ionic bond with the carboxylate group of arachidonate and that this interaction is an important contributor to the overall strength of arachidonate binding to PGHS-1. In contrast, we report here that R120Q human PGHS-2 (hPGHS-2) and native hPGHS-2 have very similar kinetic properties, but R120L hPGHS-2 catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate inefficiently. Our data indicate that the guanido group of Arg-120 of hPGHS-2 interacts with arachidonate through a hydrogen bond rather than an ionic bond and that this interaction is much less important for arachidonate binding to PGHS-2 than to PGHS-1. The Km values of PGHS-1 and -2 for arachidonate are the same, and all but one of the core residues of the active sites of the two isozymes are identical. Thus, the results of our studies of Arg-120 of PGHS-1 and -2 imply that interactions involved in the binding of arachidonate to PGHS-1 and -2 are quite different and that residues within the hydrophobic cyclooxygenase channel must contribute more significantly to arachidonate binding to PGHS-2 than to PGHS-1. As observed previously with R120Q PGHS-1, flurbiprofen was an ineffective inhibitor of R120Q hPGHS-2. PGHS-2-specific inhibitors including NS398, DuP-697, and SC58125 had IC50 values for the R120Q mutant that were up to 1,000-fold less than those observed for native hPGHS-2; thus, the positively charged guanido group of Arg-120 interferes with the binding of these compounds. NS398 did not cause time-dependent inhibition of R120Q hPGHS-2, whereas DuP-697 and SC58125 were time-dependent inhibitors. Thus, Arg-120 is important for the time-dependent inhibition of hPGHS-2 by NS398 but not by DuP-697 or SC58125.
10363282	Role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) secreted by parasitic nematodes on the growth of the cell line from epithelial origin HT29-D4.	The excretory-secretory (E-S) products of the parasitic nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Nematodirus battus were found to modify the in vitro proliferation of the tumorous colic HT29-D4 cell line of epithelial origin. A characteristic feature of these E-S products is the presence of a high level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, the biological significance of which remains unclear. To determine a possible role of AChE on cell growth, the enzyme was purified from E-S products using edrophonium chloride. Purity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using silver and Karnovsky stains, before assessing its effects on cell proliferation. The purified AChE was incorporated at different concentrations in a culture medium of HT29-D4 cells. A mitogenic effect was shown for low concentrations (0.1-14 units). By contrast, an inhibitory effect was noted at high concentrations (35-1400 units). Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies were prepared and depletion of AChE in E-S products by immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography resulted in a partial or total disappearance of the stimulatory effect of cell growth. Thus, the results form this in vitro study suggest a modulatory role for AChE secreted by nematode parasites on the proliferation of epithelial cells of the host.
10365684	Methimazole and propylthiouracil increase cellular thyroid peroxidase activity and thyroid peroxidase mRNA in cultured porcine thyroid follicles.	Methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are common antithyroid drugs for treating hyperthyroidism because the 2 drugs inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-catalyzed thyroid hormone formation. We studied whether the 2 drugs actually inhibit cellular TPO activity in cultured porcine follicles. Porcine follicles were cultured in the presence of 1 mU/mL thyrotropin (TSH) for 7 days. Then follicles were exposed to MMI or PTU in the presence of 0.1 microM Kl for 2 days. TPO activity was measured in the 100,000 x g-pellet of the thyroid sonicate by the guaiacol oxidation method. Exposure to MMI (1 microM and 10 microM) or PTU (10 microM and 100 microM) for 2 days caused a significant increase in cellular TPO activity; 100 microM MMI inhibited cellular TPO activity. The presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating system (forskolin) in TSH-free medium increased MMI-mediated TPO activity. Cyclohexamide inhibited MMI-mediated TPO activation, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for increased TPO activity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed an increase in TPO mRNA by PTU or MMI. In conclusion, MMI and PTU at therapeutic concentrations can increase TPO mRNA and cellular TPO activity, although the 2 drugs inhibit the TPO-H2O2-mediated catalytic reaction.
10368402	Maturation of neuromuscular transmission during early development in zebrafish.	We have examined the rapid development of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in zebrafish embryos and larvae by patch-clamp recording of spontaneous miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) and single acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channels. Embryonic (24-36 h) mEPCs recorded in vivo were small in amplitude (<50 pA). The rate of mEPCs increased in larvae (3.5-fold increase measured by 6 days), and these mEPCs were mostly of larger amplitude (10-fold on average) with (</=5-fold) faster kinetics. Intracellular labeling with Lucifer yellow indicated extensive coupling between muscle cells in both embryos and larvae (</=10 days). Blocking acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with eserine had no effect on mEPC kinetics in embryos at 1 day and only partially slowed (by approximately 1/2) the decay rate in larvae at 6 days. In acutely dissociated muscle cells, we observed the same two types of AChR with conductances of 45 and 60 pS and with similar, brief (<0.5 ms) mean open times in both embryos and larvae. We conclude that AChR properties are set early during development at these early stages; functional maturation of the NMJ is only partly shaped by expression of AChE and may also depend on postsynaptic AChR clustering and presynaptic maturation.
10372826	Ex vivo assay to determine the cyclooxygenase selectivity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	1. In this study we describe experiments to establish ex vivo the selectivity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) given in vivo. 2. Anaesthetised (Inactin, 120 mg kg(-1)) male Wistar rats (220-250 g) received an i.v. dose of one of the following compounds (dose mg kg(-1)): aspirin (20), diclofenac (3), L-745,337 (30), nimesulide (15), salicylate (20), sulindac (10). Blood samples were taken before and up to 6 h after dosing and the plasma obtained from it was tested for its ability to inhibit prostanoid formation in IL-1beta-treated A549 cells (COX-2 system) and human washed platelets (COX-1 system). For control the same compounds were also added directly to the assay systems. 3. All drugs, except sodium salicylate, inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 when added directly to the test systems. Plasma from aspirin-treated rats was without effect on either COX-1 or COX-2, consistent with the rapid in vivo metabolism to salicylate. Conversely, plasma from sulindac-treated rats inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 with potencies according with in vivo metabolism to sulindac sulphide. Diclofenac was COX-1/2 non-selective when tested in vitro, but a slightly preferential inhibitor of COX-2 when tested ex vivo. Nimesulide was confirmed as preferential inhibitor of COX-2 both in vitro and ex vivo. L-745,337 was a selective COX-2 inhibitor when tested in vitro or ex vivo. 4. In conclusion, our experiments show clearly (a) NSAIDs inactivation, (b) activation of prodrugs, and (c) NSAIDs selectivity. Our assay provides useful information about the selectivity of NSAIDs that could be extended by the analysis of plasma samples taken from humans similarly treated with test drugs.
10374120	Disparate actions of mifepristone (RU 486) on glands and stroma in the primate endometrium.	Besides being an antiprogestin, mifepristone (RU 486) was recently shown to antagonize oestrogen-dependent growth in the endometrium. To explore the molecular mechanisms for this phenomenon, we investigated whether or not the morphological effects of mifepristone are mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR) and whether mifepristone has disparate effects on the glandular epithelium and stroma. Six groups of hypogonadal, oestrogen-primed cynomolgus monkeys were treated for 2 weeks with: vehicle only (group I); mifepristone (group II); mifepristone plus progesterone at 0.2 mg/kg (group III), 1.0 mg/kg (group IV) or 5.0 mg/kg (group V); and progesterone only (5.0 mg/kg) (group VI). Histomorphological evaluation showed strikingly compacted stroma in the mifepristone-exposed endometria (group II), which was partially reversible by additional progesterone treatment (groups III-V). Glandular proliferation (pseudostratification, glandular mitoses) in mifepristone-treated monkeys was not significantly different from that in vehicle (oestradiol)-treated monkeys, but was inhibited by progesterone-only treatment. Cells containing vacuoles were scarce in the mifepristone-exposed endometrium, but detected frequently in progesterone-exposed endometria, indicating the strong antisecretory effect of mifepristone on glands. We conclude that oestrogen-dependent oedema in the stroma is antagonized by mifepristone. The reversal of this effect by progesterone suggests a PR-mediated mechanism. In glands, mifepristone is antiprogestogenic, but not antioestrogenic. Thus, stromal cells may be the target of antiprogestin-induced inhibition of oedema and endometrial growth.
10374898	Affinity profiles of various muscarinic antagonists for cloned human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes and mAChRs in rat heart and submandibular gland.	A family of five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has been identified based on their molecular structures and second signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we examined the antagonist binding profiles of 9 muscarinic antagonists (atropine, 4-DAMP, pirenzepine, oxybutynin, tiquizium, timepidium, propiverine, darifenacin and zamifenacin) for human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (m1, m2, m3, m4 and m5) produced by using a baculovirus infection system in Sf9 insect cells, and rat tissue membrane preparations (heart and submandibular gland). In a scopolamine methyl chloride [N-methyl-3H]- ([3H]NMS) binding assay, pirenzepine and timepidium displayed the highest affinities for the m1 and m2 subtypes, respectively, and both zamifenacin and darifenacin had the highest affinities for the m3 subtype, although the selectivities among the five subtypes were less than 10-fold. Propiverine showed a slightly higher affinity for the m5 subtype, whereas none of the drugs used in this study was uniquely selective for the m4 subtype. The binding affinities of muscarinic antagonists for rat heart and submandibular gland strong correlated with those for human cloned m2 and m3 subtypes, respectively. These data suggest that [3H]NMS binding studies using rat heart and submandibular gland might be useful methods which predict the affinities of test drugs for human muscarinic M2 and M3 receptor subtypes.
10376921	Block of HERG potassium channels by the antihistamine astemizole and its metabolites desmethylastemizole and norastemizole.	The selective H1-receptor antagonist astemizole (Hismanal) causes acquired long QT syndrome. Astemizole blocks the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current I(Kr) and the human ether-a go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ channels that underlie it. Astemizole also is rapidly metabolized. The principal metabolite is desmethylastemizole, which retains H1-receptor antagonist properties, has a long elimination time of 9 to 13 days, and its steady-state serum concentration exceeds that of astemizole by more than 30-fold. A second metabolite is norastemizole, which appears in serum in low concentrations following astemizole ingestion and has undergone development as a new antihistamine drug. Our objective in the present work was to study the effects of desmethylastemizole, norastemizole, and astemizole on HERG K+ channels.
10378121	Depression of acetylcholinesterase synthesis following transient cerebral ischemia in rat: pharmacohistochemical and biochemical investigation.	The effect of transient cerebral ischemia on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) synthesis was studied in rats by a modified pharmacohistochemical method. The procedure involved in vivo irreversible inhibition of AChE by administration of the inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; 1.2 mg/kg b.w., i.m.) 1 h before 30 min forebrain ischemia (the four-vessel occlusion model). At the onset of ischemia, 70-75% of AChE was inhibited in the brain. Recirculation was followed by histochemical and biochemical investigations of newly synthesized AChE in the striatum, septum, cortex and hippocampus. Control sham-operated animals were treated with the same dose of DFP. For correlation, rats not treated with DFP were subjected to the same ischemic procedures and investigated simultaneously. In these rats, significant decrease in AChE activity was found in the striatum, septum and hippocampus during 24 h recirculation. In DFP treated rats, ischemia markedly depressed resynthesis of AChE; after 4 h recirculation, AChE activity was decreased by 45-60% in all investigated areas in comparison with controls and the AChE histochemistry showed only slightly stained neurons in the striatum and septum. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, these neurons were densely stained and the increase in AChE activity indicated a partial recovery of the enzyme synthesis. These results suggest that the depression of AChE synthesis after forebrain ischemia is probably transient, not accompanied by cholinergic neuron degeneration.
10403429	NGF mediates the neuroprotective effect of the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol in vitro and in vivo: evidence from an NGF-antisense study.	Previous studies in our laboratory suggested that neuroprotective effects of the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol in vitro and in vivo occurred due to enhanced synthesis of nerve growth factor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a phosphothioated NGF oligodeoxynucleotide on neuroprotection by clenbuterol in vitro and in vivo. After clenbuterol treatment (1-100 microM) an increase in nerve growth factor mRNA and protein levels (200-300% of control) was observed in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. Nerve growth factor antisense oligonucleotide (0.3-1 microM for 3 days) reduced the content of nerve growth factor protein in the medium of the astrocytes concentration-dependently to 20% of control level. Nerve growth factor content in the medium of mixed hippocampal cells was reduced to 55% of sister cultures receiving the vehicle or a random control oligonucleotide. In mixed hippocampal cultures pretreated with random oligonucleotide (1 microM, 30 h), clenbuterol (10 microM) reduced the percentage of damaged neurons after glutamate exposure (0.5 mM, 1 h) to 17%. Pretreatment with nerve growth factor antisense oligonucleotide (1 microM) for 30 h before glutamate incubation blocked the protective effect of clenbuterol. In vivo, clenbuterol (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) reduced the infarct volume in a rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia dose-dependently. Nerve growth factor antisense oligonucleotides injected into the cortical tissue before ischemia abolished the cerebroprotective effect of clenbuterol. Our results indicate that the nerve growth factor antisense oligonucleotide presented in this study is a useful tool to investigate the effects of nerve growth factor knock down. By using the nerve growth factor antisense oligonucleotide we could demonstrate that nerve growth factor mediated the neuroprotective effects of the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol in vitro and in vivo.
10403500	Methylphenidate and cocaine have a similar in vivo potency to block dopamine transporters in the human brain.	The reinforcing effects of cocaine and methylphenidate have been linked to their ability to block dopamine transporters (DAT). Though cocaine and methylphenidate have similar in vitro affinities for DAT the abuse of methylphenidate in humans is substantially lower than of cocaine. To test if differences in in vivo potency at the DAT between these two drugs could account for the differences in their abuse liability we compared the levels of DAT occupancies that we had previously reported separately for intravenous methylphenidate in controls and for intravenous cocaine in cocaine abusers. DAT occupancies were measured with Positron Emission Tomography using [11C]cocaine, as a DAT ligand, in 8 normal controls for the methylphenidate study and in 17 active cocaine abusers for the cocaine study. The ratio of the distribution volume of [11C]cocaine in striatum to that in cerebellum, which corresponds to Bmax/Kd +1, was used as measure of DAT availability. Parallel measures were obtained to assess the cardiovascular effects of these two drugs. Methylphenidate and cocaine produced comparable dose-dependent blockade of DAT with an estimated ED50 (dose required to block 50% of the DAT) for methylphenidate of 0.07 mg/kg and for cocaine of 0.13 mg/kg. Both drugs induced similar increases in heart rate and blood pressure but the duration of the effects were significantly longer for methylphenidate than for cocaine. The similar in vivo potencies at the DAT for methylphenidate than for cocaine are in agreement with their reported relative in vitro affinities (Ki 390 nM and 640 nM respectively), which is likely to reflect the similar degree of uptake (8-10% of the injected dose) and regional distribution of these two drugs in the human brain. Thus, differences in the in vivo potency of these two drugs at the DAT cannot be responsible for the differences in their rate of abuse in humans. Other variables i.e. longer duration of methylphenidate's side effects may counterbalance its reinforcing effects.
10413067	A comparison of the binding characteristics of class I antiarrhythmic agents for human muscarinic m1-m3 receptors.	The binding characteristics of the class 1 antiarrhythmic agents, cibenzoline, disopyramide, disopyramide metabolite (the main active metabolite of disopyramide in humans), and pirmenol, for human muscarinic receptors (m1-m3) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were investigated by binding assay with [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) as a ligand. All of these agents inhibited the specific [3H]NMS binding to membrane preparations in a concentration-dependent manner. The potencies of affinity of these agents for m1, m2, and m3 receptors (compared by IC50) were disopyramide > pirmenol > disopyramide metabolite > cibenzoline, pirmenol > cibenzoline > disopyramide > disopyramide metabolite, and disopyramide > disopyramide metabolite > pirmenol > cibenzoline, respectively. Some competition curves of cibenzoline, disopyramide, and pirmenol were shallow, and Hill coefficients of these curves differed from unity, suggesting that these agents have allosteric binding characteristics for human muscarinic receptors. The m2-selective ratios to m1 (IC50 m1/IC50 m2) and m3 (IC50 m3/IC50 m2) of cibenzoline were 4.0 and 16, and those of pirmenol were 6.5 and 43, respectively, whereas those of disopyramide and its metabolite ranged from 0.46 to 1.6, suggesting that cibenzoline and pirmenol exerted high selectivity to the m2 receptor. We conclude that (a) all class 1 antiarrhythmic agents in this study have inhibitory effects on human m1, m2, and m3 receptors, and some of those binding may show allosteric characterization; (b) disopyramide and its metabolite have similar affinity to m1 to m3 receptors; and (c) cibenzoline and pirmenol have high m2-selective ratios to m1 and m3.
10418858	Insulin resistance and thrombosis: a cardiologist's view.	Atherogenesis in the vasculature is accelerated by changes in the dynamic equilibrium between endogenous tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Increased expression of PAI-1, decreased expression of tissue plasminogen activator, or both can lead to decreased fibrinolytic activity and predispose to thrombosis. Increased concentrations of insulin (and proinsulin) in the plasma increase plasma PAI-1, although the mechanisms of this effect are not known. In addition, it has been observed that basal fibrinolytic activity is decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes; this may accelerate atherosclerosis by exposing vascular luminal wall surfaces to persistent and recurrent thrombi. Abnormalities in the vessel wall appear to contribute to the increased risk. There is also evidence that PAI-1 content is increased in atherosclerotic lesions of patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that interventions to reduce insulin resistance and improve glycemic control may improve the fibrinolytic response. Clinical studies in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, ovarian androgen overproduction, and impaired fibrinolytic capacity) demonstrated that treatment with troglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, can markedly reduce blood levels of PAI-1. There is also clinical evidence that these agents may contribute to regression of intimal medial thickness in patients with type 2 diabetes, providing further indication that antidiabetic interventions may help inhibit the progression of early atherosclerotic lesions.
10420171	Discovery of novel peptidic dopamine transporter ligands by screening a positional scanning combinatorial hexapeptide library.	The acute reinforcing effects of cocaine are thought by some to result from cocaine binding to the dopamine (DA) transporter, which inhibits DA uptake and increases synaptic DA levels in the mesolimbic system. Other data suggest that neurotransmitters other than DA contribute to cocaine reinforcement and addiction. These considerations illustrate the need to have additional research tools with which to test the "DA hypothesis." One strategy is to identify drugs which bind to the DA transporter (DAT ligands) but which do not inhibit DA uptake as effectively as cocaine. The purpose of the present study was to identify members of a novel structural class of DAT ligands and to characterize their interactions at the DA transporter. A positional scanning hexapeptide D-amino acid library was screened for inhibition of [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to rat caudate DA transporters. Based on the results, 12 peptides were synthesized. All 12 peptides inhibited [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to DA transporters with IC(50) values, which ranged from 1.8 microM to 12 microM. The two most potent peptides (TPI-669-1 and TPI-669-4) were prepared in larger quantities and were characterized further for activity at the DAT and 5-HT transporter. Both peptides inhibited DA and 5-HT uptake and transporter binding with IC(50)/K(i) values in the low micromolar range. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that both peptides increase extracellular DA and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens of rats. These data demonstrate that peptides can function as inhibitors of biogenic amine transport. Future work will focus on developing more potent and selective peptides. Published 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
10421444	The influence of peripheral site ligands on the reaction of symmetric and chiral organophosphates with wildtype and mutant acetylcholinesterases.	The rates of inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (EC 3.1.1.7) by paraoxon, haloxon, DDVP, and enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates and cationic alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines were measured in the presence and absence of AChE peripheral site inhibitors: gallamine, D-tubocurarine, propidium, atropine and derivatives of coumarin. All ligands, except the coumarins, at submillimolar concentrations enhanced the rates of inhibition by neutral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) while inhibition rates by cationic OPs were slowed down. When peripheral site ligand concentrations extended to millimolar, the extent of the enhancement decreased creating a bell shaped activation profile. Analysis of inhibition by DDVP and haloxon revealed that peripheral site inhibitors increased the second order reaction rates by increasing maximal rates of phosphylation.
10422661	Synergistic antiallodynic effects of spinal morphine with ketorolac and selective COX1- and COX2-inhibitors in nerve-injured rats.	The possible role of spinal prostanoids in the tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia associated with an experimental model of neuropathic pain was investigated. Neuropathic pain was induced by tight ligation of the L5 and L6 spinal nerves. Tactile allodynia was assessed 7 days after the surgery by measuring hindpaw withdrawal threshold to probing with von Frey filaments. Thermal hyperalgesia and nociception were determined by the 52 degrees C warm-water tail-flick test and by applying radiant heat to the plantar aspect of the hindpaw ipsilateral to the ligation. Minimal antiallodynic effect was produced by intrathecal (i.th.) administration of ketorolac or morphine up to the highest testable dose (100 microg) or by the (R)- or (S)-enantiomers of ketorolac (up to 6 microg) when administered alone. However, i.th. administration of a fixed ratio (1:1) of morphine plus racemic ketorolac or of morphine plus the (S)-enantiomer of ketorolac (S-ketorolac) produced a dose- and time-related antiallodynic effect: ED50 114 +/- 35.9 microg (total dose) for morphine plus ketorolac and 70.5 +/- 21.0 microg (total dose) for morphine plus S-ketorolac. The combination of i.th. morphine plus the (R)-enantiomer of ketorolac (R-ketorolac) (up to 200 microg total dose) was without effect. Similar antiallodynic activity was obtained for the co-administration of i.th. morphine and intravenous (i.v.) racemic ketorolac. In order to investigate the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, relatively selective COX1 (piroxicam) and COX2 N-[2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl] metanesulfonamide (NS-398) inhibitors were administered i.th. (60 microg) alone or together with i.th. morphine. Piroxicam, NS-398, morphine and vehicle (90% DMSO) were without significant antiallodynic effect when administered alone, but moderate antiallodynic effects were produced by i.th. administration of fixed ratio (1:1) combinations of morphine with 60 microg each (highest soluble dose) of piroxicam (%MPE = 40.8 +/- 10.2) or NS-398 (%MPE = 32.4 +/- 9.5). Further, the combined i.th. administration of morphine, piroxicam and NS-398 in fixed 1:1:1 ratio (60 microg each) resulted in a supraadditive antiallodynic effect (%MPE = 70.4 +/- 10.8). Finally, morphine, but not ketorolac, given i.th. produced dose-dependent anti nociception in either the tail-flick or the paw-flick tests. However, there was no synergy between morphine and ketorolac against thermal nociception in either of the tests. These findings suggest that spinal prostanoids produced via both COX1 and COX2 pathways may play a role in neuropathic pain states and suggest the clinical utility of opioid plus COX-inhibitor combination therapy.
10422790	Epinastine, a nonsedating histamine H1 receptor antagonist, has a negligible effect on HERG channel.	Terfenadine and astemizole rarely cause cardiac arrhythmias by suppressing the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K+ channel encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). Epinastine, however, has not been reported to have the adverse effect. We have therefore compared the effects of epinastine, terfenadine and astemizole on HERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Terfenadine and astemizole suppressed the HERG current with IC50 of 431 nM and 69 nM, respectively. In contrast, 100 microM epinastine inhibited the HERG current by only 11+/-2.1%. These results may provide an explanation for the difference in the cardiotoxicity between different nonsedating histamine H1 receptor antagonists.
10428422	Modulation of 5-HT1A receptor signalling by point-mutation of cysteine351 in the rat Galpha(o) protein.	The activity state of G proteins is involved in the ligands' maximal responses that can be produced by activating the 5-HT1A receptor (Pauwels et al., 1997). The present study investigated the ligand responses at the recombinant h 5-HT1A receptor (RC: 2.1.5HT.01A) as mediated by the Galpha(o) protein. Therefore, a fusion protein was constructed between the 5-HT1A receptor and a pertussis toxin resistant rat Galpha(o)Cys351Gly mutant protein to define its pharmacological properties at a receptor: Galpha(o) protein density ratio of 1. Pertussis toxin treatment (100 ng/ml) affected neither the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor fusion protein as measured by [3H] MPPF (3.0+/-0.7 pmol/mg protein) nor the 5-HT-mediated [35S]GTPgammaS binding response (146+/-34 fmol/mg protein) in Cos-7 cells. 8-OH-DPAT (Emax: 55+/-7%) and buspirone (Emax: 22+/-4%) yielded partial agonist activity as compared to 5-HT, whereas WAY 100635 acted as a competitive antagonist (pK(B): 9.75+/-0.17). The magnitude of the 8-OH-DPAT response (Emax, %) was highly dependent on the nature of the amino acid 351 in the C-terminus of the Galpha(o) protein: Ile351 (93+/-4) > Cys351 (79+/-3) > Gly351 (55+/-7). The Emax values (%) of buspirone displayed the following gradient: 69+/-5 approximately/= 62+/-8 > 22+/-4. For comparison, maximal responses of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone were enhanced versus 5-HT upon co-expression of the 5-HT1A receptor with the respective Galpha(o) proteins, probably due to an altered receptor: Galpha(o) protein density ratio. In conclusion, residue 351 of the rat Galpha(o) protein is involved in determining the magnitude of 5-HT1A receptor activation that ligands can produce at these receptors. Moreover, the fusion protein approach allows quantitative comparisons of the intrinsic activities of ligands between one single receptor subtype with different Galpha protein subtypes.
10430100	Antitumor activity of ZD1694 (tomudex) against human head and neck cancer in nude mouse models: role of dosing schedule and plasma thymidine.	We studied the antitumor activity and toxicity of ZD1694 (tomudex), a specific inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), in nude mice bearing human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma A253 and FaDu xenografts. Mice were treated by single i.v. push (i.v. x 1), i.v. push once a week for 3 weeks (weekly x 3), and i.v. push once a day for 5 days (daily x 5), and the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of ZD1694 were 300 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg/week, and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. ZD1694 was moderately active against both A253 and FaDu xenografts. Antitumor activity was schedule-dependent in both tumors: weekly x 3 > or = i.v. x 1 > daily x 5. In contrast, the rank order of toxicity was daily x 5 > weekly x 3 > or = i.v. x 1. ZD1694 at the MTD produced 20% complete tumor regression and 20% partial tumor regression (PR) with i.v. x 1 and weekly x 3 schedules and 12-day tumor growth delay with daily x 5 schedule against FaDu xenografts. No complete tumor regression was achieved with ZD1694 with any schedule against A253; a 20% PR, 40% PR, and 10-day tumor growth delay were observed with i.v. x 1, weekly x 3, and daily x 5 schedules, respectively. The data indicate that ZD1694 was slightly more effective against FaDu than against A253. Of interest and potential clinical importance was the observation that ZD1694 was still active at doses lower than the MTD (> or =1/3 MTD), which showed a high therapeutic index and wide safety margin. Study of ZD1694 compared with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine at the MTD revealed that the antitumor activity of ZD1694 was comparable with or superior to 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine against both A253 and FaDu xenografts, with less toxicity. High plasma thymidine in mouse relative to human (approximately 1.3 microM and <0.1 microM, respectively) may complicate the study of antitumor activity and toxicity of TS inhibitors with human tumor xenografts grown in the mouse. To test this hypothesis, we preadministered methoxypolyethyleneglycol-conjugated thymidine phosphorylase (MPEG-TPase; 2500 units/kg/dose) to reduce mouse plasma thymidine, then treated with various doses of ZD1694 using the daily x 5 or i.v. x 1 schedules in the A253 tumor model. MPEG-TPase significantly increased the toxicity of ZD1694; the MTD of ZD1694 plus MPEG-TPase was reduced 3- and 10-fold compared with ZD1694 alone for i.v x 1 and daily x 5 schedules, respectively. However, preadministration of MPEG-TPase did not potentiate the antitumor activity of ZD1694 with either schedule. The data indicate that the study of TS inhibitors in rodent models may not be suitable for predicting a safe dose for clinical study. However, rodent models, particularly human tumor xenografts, are still useful models for evaluation of antitumor activity and schedule selection for TS inhibitors.
10433496	Inverse agonist activities of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rat myocardium.	1. Negative inotropic effects of several beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) antagonists on electrically-stimulated right atria, left atria, right ventricles and left ventricular papillary muscles from reserpine-treated rats were used as a measure of their inverse agonist activities. 2. Beta1AR antagonists acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol, beta2AR antagonist ICI-181,551 and nonselective betaAR antagonists alprenolol, nadolol, propranolol and timolol produced negative inotropic effects, which were most marked on the right atria. 3. The nonselective betaAR antagonist pindolol did not exhibit inverse agonist activity but inhibited the negative inotropic activities of ICI-118,551, atenolol and propranolol. 4. The negative inotropic effects of lidocaine, nifedipine and pentobarbitone were similar on all the four myocardial preparations. 5. The positive inotropic efficacy of salbutamol on right and left atria but not on right ventricles and papillary muscles was comparable to that of isoprenaline. The antagonist activity of ICI-118,551 against isoprenaline was greater on right atria than on other cardiac regions. 6. Beta1AR proteins were expressed in all regions of the heart but of beta2AR were primarily localized in the right atrium. 7. It is concluded that beta2AR play a greater role in right atria than in other cardiac regions and almost all betaAR antagonists behave as inverse agonists.
10433700	Phosphoryl oxime inhibition of acetylcholinesterase during oxime reactivation is prevented by edrophonium.	Reactivation of organophosphate (OP)-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key objective in the treatment of OP poisoning. This study with native, wild-type, and mutant recombinant DNA-expressed AChEs, each inhibited by representative OP compounds, establishes a relationship between edrophonium acceleration of oxime-induced reactivation of OP-AChE conjugates and phosphoryl oxime inhibition of the reactivated enzyme that occurs during reactivation by pyridinium oximes LüH6 and TMB4. No such recurring inhibition could be observed with HI-6 as the reactivator due to the extreme lability of the phosphoryl oximes formed by this oxime. Phosphoryl oximes formed during reactivation of the ethoxy methylphosphonyl-AChE conjugate by LüH6 and TMB4 were isolated for the first time and their structures confirmed by (31)P NMR. However, phosphoryl oximes formed during the reactivation of the diethylphosphoryl-AChE conjugate were not sufficiently stable to be detected by (31)P NMR. The purified ethoxy methylphosphonyl oximes formed during the reactivation of ethoxy methylphosphonyl-AChE conjugate with LüH6 and TMB4 are 10- to 22-fold more potent than MEPQ as inhibitors of AChE and stable for several hours at pH 7.2 in HEPES buffer. Reactivation of both ethoxy methylphosphonyl- and diethylphosphoryl-AChE by these two oximes was accelerated in the presence of rabbit serum paraoxonase, suggesting that organophosphorus hydrolase can hydrolyze phosphoryl oxime formed during the reactivation. Our results emphasize that certain oximes, such as LüH6 and TMB4, if used in the treatment of OP pesticide poisoning may cause prolonged inhibition of AChE due to formation of phosphoryl oximes.
10435395	The effects of single dose nefazodone and paroxetine upon 5-HT2A binding potential in humans using [18F]-setoperone PET.	Alterations in 5-HT2A receptor binding are implicated in suicidality and depression. 5-HT2A receptors may also be involved in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants.
10435400	Pindolol binding to 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain confirmed with positron emission tomography.	The augmentation effect of (-)pindolol as used in combination with SSRI to treat major depression has been ascribed to blocking of dorsal raphe nucleus cell body 5-HT autoreceptors. In this study, the radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 and positron emission tomography were used to establish whether pindolol at a clinical dose level (10 mg s.o.d.) occupies 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain in vivo. Three healthy males were recruited and each subject was used as his own control. The 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was calculated for the frontal and temporal cortex and the raphe nuclei, using and a ratio analysis with the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Maximal pindolol plasma concentration was reached within 3 h after drug administration. Two hours after pindolol administration, the regional 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was within the range 7-21% in the three subjects. The study confirms that the 5-HT1A-receptor may be a clinically significant target for pindolol.
10444479	Myocardial tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in hypertensive and heart failure-prone rats.	Acute increases in blood pressure (BP) increase myocardial tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production, but it is not known whether chronic hypertensive stress elevates myocardial TNF-alpha production, possibly contributing to cardiac remodeling, decreased cardiac function, and faster progression to heart failure. BP, cardiac function, and size were evaluated in normotensive [Sprague-Dawley (SD)], spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure-prone (SHHF) rats at 6, 12, 15, and 18 mo of age and in failing SHHF. Left ventricular tissues were evaluated for secretion of bioactive TNF-alpha and inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion by phosphodiesterase inhibitors. All ventricles secreted bioactive and immunoreactive TNF-alpha, but secretion decreased with age. SHR and SHHF rats secreted more TNF-alpha than SD rats at 6 mo of age, but only failing SHHF rats secreted significantly more TNF-alpha at 18 mo. Amrinone inhibited TNF-alpha secretion in all rats and was less potent but more efficacious than RO-201724 in all strains. TNF-alpha secretion correlated with BP and left ventricular mass in 6-mo-old rats, but this relationship disappeared with age. Results suggest that hypertension and/or cardiac remodeling is associated with elevated myocardial TNF-alpha, and, although hypertension, per se, did not maintain elevated cardiac TNF-alpha levels, SHHF rats increase TNF-alpha production during the end stages of failure.
10450786	The analgesic NSAID lornoxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the formation of interleukin (IL)-6 in vitro.	To investigate anti-inflammatory effects of lornoxicam in vitro on COX-1/COX-2, on NO formation from iNOS and on the formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8.
10454501	Modulation of cytochrome P-450 gene expression in endotoxemic mice is tissue specific and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha dependent.	Administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 4A mRNAs in rat liver and kidney. Because induction of the CYP4A subfamily by chemicals requires peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), we determined whether CYP4A induction by LPS also requires PPARalpha by comparing the responses of PPARalpha-null (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice. Renal expression of CYP4A10, CYP4A14, and acyl-CoA oxidase was induced by LPS treatment in (+/+) mice, and these effects were absent in the (-/-) mice. In contrast, hepatic expression of CYP4A10 was down-regulated in the (+/+) animals, and no significant induction of acyl-CoA oxidase or CYP4A14 was detected in liver. Expression of the peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme was not significantly affected by LPS treatment. These results indicate that PPARalpha is activated in mouse kidney after LPS treatment and that this leads to modulation of some PPARalpha-regulated genes. However, the species and tissue specificity of these effects suggest that inflammatory pathways may modulate the induction via PPARalpha. Mice pair fed with LPS-treated mice showed no induction of renal CYP4A10 or CYP4A14, indicating that renal CYP4A induction during endotoxemia is not due to hypophagia. Down-regulation of CYP2A5, CYP2C29, and CYP3A11 by LPS was attenuated or blocked in the (-/-) mice, suggesting a role for PPARalpha in CYP down-regulation as well. Finally, we found that clofibrate caused an acute induction of two hepatic acute-phase mRNAs that was only partially dependent on PPARalpha.
10455274	Pharmacological evidence that alpha1-and alpha2-adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs.	Vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses may be involved in the therapeutic action of acutely acting anti-migraine agents, including the triptans and ergot alkaloids. While 5-HT1B/1D receptors mediate the effect of triptans, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine also interact with alpha-adrenoceptors. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptors in mediating vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs. Ten minute intracarotid infusions of phenylephrine (1, 3 and 10 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or BHT 933 (3, 10 and 30 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) produced dose-dependent decreases in total carotid and arteriovenous anastomotic conductances; no changes were observed in the capillary fraction. The carotid vascular effects of phenylephrine and BHT 933 were selectively abolished by prazosin (100 microg kg(-1), i.v.) and rauwolscine (300 microg kg(-1), i.v.), respectively. The responses to phenylephrine and BHT 933 were not affected by the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR127935 (500 microg kg(-1), i.v.). These results show that both alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptors can mediate vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs. Since vasoconstrictor activity in this in vivo model is predictive of anti-migraine activity, an agonist activity at particularly the alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes, in view of their less ubiquitous nature, could provide migraine abortive potential. Thus, the present results may aid further understanding of the mode of action of some current anti-migraine agents and may eventually be helpful in the development of future treatment in migraine.
10455282	Involvement of 5-HT1B receptors in collar-induced hypersensitivity to 5-hydroxytryptamine of the rabbit carotid artery.	In humans intimal thickening is aprerequisite of atherosclerosis. Application of a silicone collar around the rabbit carotid artery induces an intimal thickening but in addition it increases the sensitivity to the vasoconstrictor action of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). The 5-HT receptors involved in collar-induced hypersensitivity to 5-HT were investigated using several agonists and antagonists. One week after placement of collars around both carotid arteries of anaesthetized rabbits, rings (2 mm width) from inside (=collar) and outside (=sham) the collars were mounted in organ baths (10 ml) for isometric force measurements at 6 g loading tension. Collared rings were more sensitive to the contractile effect of 5-HT (7.6 fold) and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (31 fold, 5-CT, 5-HT1 agonist) in cumulative concentration response curves. Sumatriptan (5-HT1B/1D agonist) caused concentration-dependent constrictions in collared rings only. Collar placement did not significantly alter pA2 values (Schild regression) or apparent pKb values (non-linear regression) of spiperone and methysergide (mixed 5-HT2A/5-HT1 antagonists) or ketanserin and ritanserin (5-HT2A antagonists), indicating unchanged binding characteristics of the 5-HT2A receptor. However, the reduced slope of the Schild regression pointed to a heterogeneous receptor population in collared rings. In contrast, the apparent pKb value of methiothepin (5-HT1B antagonist) was significantly reduced by collar placement, and its antagonism shifted from non-surmountable in sham rings to surmountable in collared segments. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the serotonergic receptor involved in the hypersensitivity to 5-HT of rabbit collared carotid artery is a 5-HT1B receptor subtype.
10458598	Multiple microvascular and astroglial 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtypes in human brain: molecular and pharmacologic characterization.	Physiologic and anatomic evidence suggest that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons regulate local cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier permeability. To evaluate the possibility that some of these effects occur directly on the blood vessels, molecular and/or pharmacologic approaches were used to assess the presence of 5-HT receptors in human brain microvascular fractions, endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures, as well as in astroglial cells which intimately associate with intraparenchymal blood vessels. Isolated microvessels and capillaries consistently expressed messages for the h5-HT1B, h5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A but not 5-HT7 receptors. When their distribution within the vessel wall was studied in more detail, it was found that capillary endothelial cells exhibited mRNA for the h5-HT1D and for the 5-HT7 receptors whereas microvascular smooth muscle cells, in addition to h5-HT1D and 5-HT7, also showed polymerase chain reaction products for h5-HT1B receptors. Expression of 5-HT1F and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs was never detected in any of the microvascular cell cultures. In contrast, messages for all 5-HT receptors tested were detected in human brain astrocytes with a predominance of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 subtypes. In all cultures, sumatriptan inhibited (35-58%, P < .05) the forskolin-stimulated production of cyclic AMP, an effect blocked by the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonists GR127935 and GR55562. In contrast, 5-carboxamidotryptamine induced strong increases (> or = 400%, P < .005) in basal cyclic AMP levels that were abolished by mesulergine, a nonselective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist. Only astroglial cells showed a ketanserin-sensitive increase (177%, P < .05) in IP3 formation when exposed to 5-HT. These results show that specific populations of functional 5-HT receptors are differentially distributed within the various cellular compartments of the human cortical microvascular bed, and that human brain astroglial cells are endowed with multiple 5-HT receptors. These findings emphasize the complex interactions between brain serotonergic pathways and non-neuronal cells within the CNS and, further, they raise the possibility that some of these receptors may be activated by antimigraine compounds such as brain penetrant triptan derivatives.
10463324	Zolmitriptan-induced growth hormone release in humans: mediation by 5-HT1D receptors?	Effective neuroendocrine probes of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor function may facilitate investigation of the role of these receptor subtypes in the pathophysiology of depression and the mode of action of antidepressant medication.
10475242	Use of a PPAR gamma-specific monoclonal antibody to demonstrate thiazolidinediones induce PPAR gamma receptor expression in vitro.	Troglitazone and rosiglitazone (BRL49653), members of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic drugs, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands that induce adipocyte differentiation and increase the expression of PPARgamma protein. Here, we report the characterization of a PPARgamma specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), PgammaA53.25, and its use to monitor PPARgamma expression in the noncommitted pluripotent murine mesenchymal stem cell line, C3H10T1/2, treated with TZDs. MAb PgammaA53.25 was raised against a region in the N-terminal domain of human PPARgamma shared by splice variants PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2. It recognizes immunizing antigen in enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA), and does not cross-react with the N-terminal domains of PPARalpha or PPARdelta. In Western blotting, PgammaA53.25 reacts with the immunizing antigen as well as distinct protein bands corresponding to the molecular weight of full length PPARgamma from C3H10T1/2 cells and rat tissue lysates. In fluorescent microscopy, PgammaA53.25 immunostains nuclei of C3H10T1/2 cells treated with PPARgamma ligands. The fluorescence intensity of the treated cells is TZD dose-dependent, and correlates with lipid accumulation consistent with adipogenesis. Based on these results, we propose that MAb PgammaA53.25 will be a useful tool for elucidating the role of PPARgamma in fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation.
10482907	Antisense down-regulation of thymidylate synthase to suppress growth and enhance cytotoxicity of 5-FUdR, 5-FU and Tomudex in HeLa cells.	1. Thymidylate synthase (TS), the key enzyme in de novo synthesis of thymidine, is an important target for antitumour chemotherapy. It was hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide down-regulation of TS mRNA would decrease TS levels and enhance the cytotoxicity of inhibitors of TS, including the pyrimidine analogues 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FUdR), and the folate analogue Tomudex (ICI D1694; N-(5-[N-(3, 4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino ]-2-theon yl-L-glutamic acid). 2. 2'-Methoxyethoxylated, phosphorothioated 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), complementary to various sequences in TS mRNA, were synthesized, along with control oligomers consisting of the same, respective bases in randomized order, against which all the biological effects were compared. Following a 6-h transfection of HeLa cells using polycationic liposome at 3 microg ml(-1), ODN 83 (50 nM), complementary to a region in the 3'-untranslated region of the TS mRNA, decreased TS mRNA levels by approximately 70% within 24 h. ODN 83 also decreased TS enzyme activity, as measured by binding of TS to radiolabelled 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. In addition to inhibiting proliferation by up to approximately 40%, ODN 83 enhanced the cytotoxicity of Tomudex or 5-FU, added 1 day following transfection, by 50 - 60%. ODN 83 also enhanced sensitivity to 5-FUdR by 70%, but did not affect the toxicity of cisplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, doxorubicin, ionizing radiation, paclitaxel, or irinotecan. 3. These data indicate that antisense ODN down-regulation of TS can inhibit human tumour cell proliferation and enhance the efficacy of TS-targeted drugs.
10485477	The interaction of raloxifene and the active metabolite of the antiestrogen EM-800 (SC 5705) with the human estrogen receptor.	A naturally occurring mutation at amino acid 351 (D351Y) in the human estrogen receptor (ER) can change the pharmacology of antiestrogens. Raloxifene is converted from an antiestrogen to an estrogen, whereas the biological properties of the steroidal pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 are not affected by the D351Y ER (Levenson, A. S., and Jordan, V. C. Cancer Res., 58: 1872-1875, 1998). We propose an assay system that can be used to classify antiestrogens by determining their ability to up-regulate transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) mRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with either wild-type or D351Y ER. The novel compound EM-800 and its active metabolite, EM-652, have been reported to be p.o. active nonsteroidal pure antiestrogens. Using the D351Y cell line, EM-652 is able to up-regulate TGF-alpha mRNA in a dose-dependent manner and to a similar extent as estradiol, whereas in the wild-type cell line, it acts as an antiestrogen. In addition, the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 is capable of inhibiting EM-652-induced TGF-alpha mRNA expression at the D351Y ER. In MCF-7 cells expressing wild-type ER, it has previously been shown that ICI 182,780 decreases ER only at the protein level. EM-652 treatment does not decrease ER protein levels to a similar extent as ICI 182,780 treatment, and, in addition, EM-652 has no effect on ER mRNA levels. In proliferation assays, EM-652 is as effective as raloxifene in inhibiting cell growth. From these studies, we conclude that the reason the pharmacology of EM-652 is similar to that of raloxifene is because they both fit the ER in the same manner, and their biology depends on an interaction of the antiestrogenic side chain with amino acid 351.
10485483	Increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human pancreatic carcinomas and cell lines: growth inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein expression were found to be frequently elevated in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cell lines derived from such tumors. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic COX-2 expression in 14 of 21 (67%) pancreatic carcinomas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was found to be elevated in carcinomas, relative to histologically normal pancreas from a healthy individual, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. COX-2 protein expression was detected by the Western blot assay in three of five pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (BxPC-3, Capan-1, and MDAPanc-3), whereas COX-1 protein was detected in two of the five cell lines (BxPC-3 and Capan-1). Increased levels of COX-2 mRNA were found in four of five cell lines, and only in PANC-1 cells was the low level of transcript comparable to that in the normal pancreas. The level of COX-2 mRNA was positively correlated with the differentiation status of the tumor of origin for each cell line, COX-2 protein expression was up-regulated by epidermal growth factor when the cells were grown in absence of serum. Finally, two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac sulfide and NS398, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in all pancreatic cell lines tested. No correlation was found between the level of COX-2 or COX-1 expression and the extent of growth inhibition. Treatment of BxPC-3 cells with sulindac sulfide and NS398 resulted in an induction of COX-2 expression. Our findings indicate that COX-2 up-regulation is a frequent event in pancreatic cancers and suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of pancreatic carcinoma.
10494028	Cell culture conditions determine apolipoprotein CIII secretion and regulation by fibrates in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.	Fibrates are widely used drugs which lower triglycerides and increase HDL concentrations in serum. Recent findings from our laboratory have shown that fibrates repress apolipoprotein (apo) CIII gene expression, an effect that explains partially the triglyceride-lowering activity of these drugs. The goal of the present study was to compare the effect of various fibrates on apo CIII gene expression in the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. First, we demonstrate that the level of apo CIII secretion by HepG2 cells is controlled by serum factors whereas apo CIII mRNA levels are not and even increase under conditions when apo CIII secretion dramatically decreases. Twelve different fetal calf serum batches were tested during this study and apo CIII secretion in cell medium could only be detected with three of them. The effect of serum on apolipoprotein secretion was more pronounced for apo CIII whereas other apolipoproteins (apo E, apo B, apo AII and apo AI) were affected to a lesser extent. Under serum conditions allowing apo CIII secretion, treatment with the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)alpha activators fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and Wy-14643 result in a marked lowering of apo CIII secretion and gene expression, this effect being most pronounced with Wy-14643. Comparison of the activity of a PPARgamma-specific ligand, the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione, BRL-49653 and a PPARalpha ligand Wy-14643 showed a marked decrease of apo CIII secretion and gene expression after activation of PPARalpha but not PPARgamma. In conclusion, fibrates down-regulate apo CIII gene expression in human HepG2 cells, most likely via PPARalpha but not via PPARgamma. However, these effects are only observed in HepG2 cells cultured under appropriate conditions.
10494488	Variations of progesterone receptor and c-fos gene expression in the rat uterus after treatment with norethisterone and its A-ring reduced metabolites.	It has been suggested that some contraceptive derivatives of 19-nor-testosterone possess estrogenic activity that may facilitate the development of breast cancer. The aim of this work was to investigate the estrogenic properties of norethisterone (NET) and its A-ring-reduced derivatives by determining progesterone receptor (PR) and c-fos mRNA content of two estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus of ovariectomized rats. mRNA content was evaluated by Northern blot 1-6 h after 17 beta-estradiol administration. The highest PR and c-fos mRNA content was observed 3 h and 2 h after 17 beta-estradiol administration, respectively. NET did not modify either PR or c-fos mRNA content. In contrast, 5 alpha- and 3 beta, 5 alpha-NET significantly increased mRNA content of both genes. The increase in c-fos mRNA content induced by these reduced compounds was lower than that found with estradiol treatment. The overall results indicate that NET administration can indirectly induce estrogenic effects through the action of its 5 alpha-dihydro and 3 beta, 5 alpha-tetrahydro derivatives.
10500149	Suppression of Delta(5)-androstenediol-induced androgen receptor transactivation by selective steroids in human prostate cancer cells.	Our earlier report suggested that androst-5-ene-3beta,7beta-diol (Delta(5)-androstenediol or Adiol) is a natural hormone with androgenic activity and that two potent antiandrogens, hydroxyflutamide (Eulexin) and bicalutamide (Casodex), fail to block completely the Adiol-induced androgen receptor (AR) transactivation in prostate cancer cells. Here, we report the development of a reporter assay to screen several selective steroids with anti-Adiol activity. Among 22 derivatives/metabolites of dehydroepiandrosterone, we found 4 steroids [no. 4, 1,3,5(10)-estratriene-17alpha-ethynyl-3, 17beta-diol; no. 6, 17alpha-ethynyl-androstene-diol; no. 8, 3beta, 17beta-dihydroxy-androst-5-ene-16-one; and no. 10, 3beta-methylcarbonate-androst-5-ene-7,17-dione] that have no androgenic activity and could also block the Adiol-induced AR transactivation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Interestingly, these compounds, in combination with hydroxyflutamide, further suppressed the Adiol-induced AR transactivation. Reporter assays further showed that these four anti-Adiol steroids have relatively lower glucocorticoid, progesterone, and estrogenic activity. Together, these data suggest some selective steroids might have anti-Adiol activity, which may have potential clinical application in the battle against the androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth.
10510461	Inhibition of the current of heterologously expressed HERG potassium channels by imipramine and amitriptyline.	1 Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are associated with cardiovascular side effects including prolongation of the QT interval of the ECG. In this report we studied the effects of two TCAs (imipramine and amitriptyline) on ionic current mediated by cloned HERG potassium channels. 2 Voltage clamp measurements of HERG currents were made from CHO cells transiently transfected with HERG cDNA. HERG-encoded potassium channels were inhibited in a reversible manner by both imipramine and amitriptyline. HERG tail currents (IHERG) following test pulses to +20 mV were inhibited by imipramine with an IC50 of 3.4+/-0.4 microM (mean+/-s.e.mean) and a Hill coefficient of 1.17+/-0.03 (n = 5). 3 microM amitriptyline inhibited IHERG by 34+/-6% (n = 3). The inhibition showed only weak voltage dependence. 3 Using an 'envelope of tails' comprised of pulses to +20 mV of varying durations, the tau of activation was found to be 155+/-30 ms for control and 132+/-26 ms for 3 microM imipramine (n = 5). Once maximal channel activation was achieved after 320 ms (as demonstrated by maximal tail currents), further prolongation of depolarization did not increase imipramine-mediated HERG channel inhibition. 4 Taking current measurements every second during a 10 s depolarizing pulse from -80 mV to 0 mV, block was observed during the first pulse in the presence of imipramine and the level of IHERG block was similar throughout the pulse (n=5). 5 A three pulse protocol (two depolarizing pulses to +20 mV separated by 20 ms at -80 mV) revealed that imipramine did not significantly alter the kinetics of IHERG inactivation. The tau of inactivation was 8+/-2 ms and 5.6+/-0.4 ms (n = 5) in the absence and presence of 3 microM imipramine, respectively, and currents inactivated to a similar extent. 6 Our data are consistent with TCAs causing components of block of the HERG channel in both the closed and open states. Any component of open channel block occurs rapidly upon depolarization. Inhibition of IHERG by the prototype TCAs imipramine and amitriptyline may suggest a mechanism for QT prolongation associated with risks of arrhythmia and sudden death that accompany high concentrations of TCAs following overdose.
10513568	Effect of donepezil hydrochloride (E2020) on basal concentration of extracellular acetylcholine in the hippocampus of rats.	The effects of oral administration of the centrally acting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, donepezil hydrochloride (donepezil: E2020: (+/-)-2-[(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-indan-1-one monohydrochloride), tacrine (9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine hydrochloride) and ENA-713 (rivastigmine: (S)-N-ethyl-3-[(1-dimethyl-amino)ethyl]-N-methyl-phenylcarbamate hydrogentartrate), which have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, on the extracellular acetylcholine concentration in the hippocampus of rats were evaluated by using a microdialysis technique without adding cholinesterase inhibitor to the perfusion solution. We also compared the inhibition of brain AChE and the brain concentrations of these drugs. Donepezil at 2.5 mg/kg and tacrine at 5 mg/kg showed significant effects for more than 6 h. At these doses, the maximum increases were observed at about 1.5 h after administration of donepezil, and at about 2 h with tacrine, and were 499% and 422% of the pre-level, respectively. ENA-713 produced significant effects at doses of 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, which lasted for about 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. The maximum increases produced by these doses at about 0.5 h after administration were 190, 346 and 458% of the pre-level, respectively. The time courses of brain AChE inhibition with donepezil at 2.5 mg/kg, tacrine at 10 mg/kg and ENA-713 at 2.5 mg/kg were mirror images of the extracellular acetylcholine-increasing action at the same doses. The time courses of the brain concentrations of drugs after oral administration of donepezil at 2.5 mg/kg and tacrine at 10 mg/kg were consistent with those of brain AChE inhibition at the same doses, and there was a linear relation between these parameters. Brain concentration of ENA-713 at 2.5 mg/kg was below the limit of quantification at all time points measured. These results suggest that oral administration of donepezil, tacrine and ENA-713 increases acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft of the hippocampus mostly through AChE inhibition, and that donepezil has a more potent activity than tacrine and a longer-lasting effect than ENA-713 on the central cholinergic system.
10518593	Pharmacological plasticity of cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium channels toward diazoxide revealed by ADP.	The pharmacological phenotype of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels is defined by their tissue-specific regulatory subunit, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), which associates with the pore-forming channel core, Kir6.2. The potassium channel opener diazoxide has hyperglycemic and hypotensive properties that stem from its ability to open K(ATP) channels in pancreas and smooth muscle. Diazoxide is believed not to have any significant action on cardiac sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels. Yet, diazoxide can be cardioprotective in ischemia and has been found to bind to the presumed cardiac sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel-regulatory subunit, SUR2A. Here, in excised patches, diazoxide (300 microM) activated pancreatic SUR1/Kir6.2 currents and had little effect on native or recombinant cardiac SUR2A/Kir6.2 currents. However, in the presence of cytoplasmic ADP (100 microM), SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels became as sensitive to diazoxide as SUR1/Kir6. 2 channels. This effect involved specific interactions between MgADP and SUR, as it required Mg(2+), but not ATP, and was abolished by point mutations in the second nucleotide-binding domain of SUR, which impaired channel activation by MgADP. At the whole-cell level, in cardiomyocytes treated with oligomycin to block mitochondrial function, diazoxide could also activate K(ATP) currents only after cytosolic ADP had been raised by a creatine kinase inhibitor. Thus, ADP serves as a cofactor to define the responsiveness of cardiac K(ATP) channels toward diazoxide. The present demonstration of a pharmacological plasticity of K(ATP) channels identifies a mechanism for the control of channel activity in cardiac cells depending on the cellular ADP levels, which are elevated under ischemia.
10529188	Lysine 22 in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase from Enterobacter cloacae is crucial for enzymatic activity and the formation of covalent adducts with the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and the antibiotic fosfomycin.	UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall component peptidoglycan. The enzyme is the target of the antibiotic fosfomycin. A lysine residue (K22), strictly conserved in MurAs and the structurally and mechanistically related 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthases (EPSPS), is located near the active center of the enzyme. This residue is thought to be involved directly in the binding of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and also to participate in the conformational change leading to the formation of the catalytically competent enzyme complex. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have replaced this lysine with arginine (K22R), valine (K22V), and glutamate (K22E). These mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized in comparison to wild-type MurA and a previously described inactive C115S mutant protein. It was found that all three K22 mutant proteins had less than 0.5% of the wild-type activity. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, it could be shown that the binding parameters for the UDP-sugar nucleotide substrate are not affected by the mutations, except for the K22E mutant protein. Similarly, binding of PEP was found to be unaffected in the K22 mutant proteins as demonstrated by tryptophan fluorescence quench titrations. On the other hand, the level of formation of a covalent adduct with either PEP or fosfomycin with the thiol group of cysteine 115 was diminished. The propensity to form an adduct with PEP decreased in the following order: wild type > K22R > K22V > K22E. A comparable effect was found on the formation of the inhibitory covalent adduct of MurA and the antibiotic fosfomycin. These results are discussed in terms of an involvement of lysine 22 in a conformational change of MurA.
10548525	Regulation of gene expression by activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma with rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) in human adipocytes.	To better define the mechanism of action of the thiazolidinediones, we incubated freshly isolated human adipocytes with rosiglitazone and investigated the changes in mRNA expression of genes encoding key proteins of adipose tissue functions. Rosiglitazone (10(-6) M, 4 h) increased p85alphaphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85alphaPI-3K) and uncoupling protein-2 mRNA levels and decreased leptin expression. The mRNA levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, Glut 4, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, acylation-stimulating protein, fatty acid transport protein-1, angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and PPARgamma1 and gamma2 were not modified by rosiglitazone treatment. Activation of RXR, the partner of PPARgamma, in the presence of rosiglitazone, increased further p85alphaPI-3K and UCP2 mRNA levels and produced a significant augmentation of Glut 4 expression. Because p85alphaPI-3K is a major component of insulin action, the induction of its expression might explain, at least in part, the insulin-sensitizing effect of the thiazolidinediones.
10555907	Effect of specific COX-2 inhibition in osteoarthritis of the knee: a 6 week double blind, placebo controlled pilot study of rofecoxib. Rofecoxib Osteoarthritis Pilot Study Group.	To determine the efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor, rofecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.
10566562	Comparison of rofecoxib and celecoxib, two cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, in postoperative dental pain: a randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled clinical trial.	Pain is a common complaint, often occurring in conjunction with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesic agents in ambulatory patients. In recent studies, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib demonstrated analgesic effects similar to those of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. The present randomized, single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to compare the analgesic efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 200 mg with that of ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with postoperative dental pain. Two hundred and seventy-two patients experiencing pain after the removal of > or =2 third molars were randomized according to pain severity (moderate vs severe) to receive a single dose of placebo (n = 45), rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 90), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 91), or ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 46). Using a patient diary, patients recorded pain intensity, pain relief, and global evaluations throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The overall analgesic effect, onset of action, peak effect, and duration of effect were evaluated, with the primary end point being total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8). The safety profile was assessed on the basis of physical findings, laboratory results, and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences. The results showed that compared with celecoxib, rofecoxib had superior analgesic effects on all measures of analgesic efficacy, including overall analgesic effect (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 12.5; P<0.001), time to onset of effect (30 vs. 60 minutes; P = 0.003), peak pain relief (score, 2.8 vs 2.3; P<0.05), and duration of effect (>24 vs. 5.1 hours; P<0.001). In addition, rofecoxib's analgesic efficacy was similar to that of ibuprofen (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 17.0; P = 0.460), but the duration was longer (P<0.05); with ibuprofen, the time to on set was 24 minutes, peak pain relief score was 2.9, and duration of analgesic effect was 8.9 hours. The safety profile was similar across all treatment groups. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with acute postoperative dental pain.
10567199	Natriuretic response to increased pressure is preserved with COX-2 inhibitors.	Elevation of renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) by direct renal interstitial volume expansion increases sodium excretion. This natriuretic response is blunted by the nonspecific inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The present study tested the hypothesis that the natriuretic response to increased RIHP during direct renal interstitial volume expansion is dependent on COX-1 but not COX-2. RIHP and fractional excretion of sodium (FE(Na)) were measured before and after direct renal interstitial volume expansion in control rats (n=7), rats infused with the COX-1 inhibitor piroxicam (n=6, 1.5 mg/kg), and rats infused with the COX-2 inhibitors NS-398 (n=5, 1.5 mg/kg) and meloxicam (n=6, 0.3 mg/kg). In control animals, direct renal interstitial volume expansion significantly increased RIHP (Delta2.3+/-0.5 mm Hg, P<0. 05) and FE(Na) (Delta1.1+/-0.3%, P<0.05). Likewise, in animals infused with NS-398 or meloxicam, direct renal interstitial volume expansion significantly increased RIHP (Delta1.8+/-0.6 mm Hg, P<0.05, and Delta1.7+/-0.3 mm Hg, P<0.05) and FE(Na) (Delta1.5+/-0.4%, P<0. 05, and Delta1.1+/-0.3%, P<0.05), respectively. In contrast, infusion of piroxicam significantly blunted the natriuretic response to direct renal interstitial volume expansion (DeltaFE(Na) 0.3+/-0. 2%), even though RIHP was increased (Delta1.9+/-0.6 mm Hg, P<0.05). Infusion of piroxicam but not NS-398 or meloxicam blunted the natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that the natriuretic response to increased blood pressure may be preserved during inhibition of COX-2.
10567922	Overexpression of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter gene induces cell proliferation and phenotypic transformation in mouse fibroblasts.	Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter activity is stimulated in early G(1) phase of the cell cycle and this stimulation was shown to be an essential event in fibroblast cell proliferation. In order to elucidate further the role of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter in cell proliferation, we overexpressed the gene encoding the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter in mouse fibroblasts, and analyzed cellular phenotypic changes. Mouse Balb/c 3T3 cells were stably transfected with the cDNA of the shark rectal gland Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter gene (NKCC1), and expressed in a mammalian vector under the cytomegalovirus promoter (Balb/c-NKCC1 cells). The transfected cells exhibited up to 10-fold greater bumetanide-sensitive Rb(+) influx compared to the control cells. The Balb/c-NKCC1 cells have acquired a typical transformation phenotype indicated by: (1) Loss of contact inhibition exhibited by growth to a higher cell density in confluent cultures, and formation of cell foci; (2) proliferation in low serum concentrations; and (3) formation of cell colonies in soft agar. The control cells transfected with the NKCC1 gene inserted in the opposite orientation in the vector retained their normal phenotype. Furthermore, the two specific inhibitors of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter activity; bumetanide and furosemide inhibited the clonogenic efficiency in the NKCC1 transfected cells. These control experiments indicate that the apparent transformation phenotype acquired by the Balb/c-NKCC1 cells was not merely associated with the process of transfection and selecting for the neomycin-resistant clones, but rather with the overexpression of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter gene. In order to ascertain that the regulated and normal expression of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter control cell proliferation, the effect of bumetanide a specific inhibitor of the cotransporter, was tested on Balb/c 3T3 cell proliferation, induced by fibroblasts growth factor (FGF) and fetal calf serum (FCS). Bumetanide inhibited synchronized Balb/c 3T3 cell exit from the G(0)/G(1) arrest and entering S-phase. The inhibition was reversible, as removal of bumetanide completely released cell proliferation. Taken together, these results propose that the NKCC1 gene is involved in the control of normal cell proliferation, while its overexpression results in apparent cell transformation, in a manner similar to some protooncogenes.
10575045	Effects of chronic antidepressant treatments on serotonin transporter function, density, and mRNA level.	To investigate functional changes in the brain serotonin transporter (SERT) after chronic antidepressant treatment, several techniques were used to assess SERT activity, density, or its mRNA content. Rats were treated by osmotic minipump for 21 d with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine or sertraline, the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine (DMI), or the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine. High-speed in vivo electrochemical recordings were used to assess the ability of the SSRI fluvoxamine to modulate the clearance of locally applied serotonin in the CA3 region of hippocampus in drug- or vehicle-treated rats. Fluvoxamine decreased the clearance of serotonin in rats treated with vehicle, DMI, or phenelzine but had no effect on the clearance of serotonin in SSRI-treated rats. SERT density in the CA3 region of the hippocampus of the same rats, assessed by quantitative autoradiography with tritiated cyanoimipramine ([(3)H]CN-IMI), was decreased by 80-90% in SSRI-treated rats but not in those treated with phenelzine or DMI. The serotonin content of the hippocampus was unaffected by paroxetine or sertraline treatment, ruling out neurotoxicity as a possible explanation for the SSRI-induced decrease in SERT binding and alteration in 5-HT clearance. Levels of mRNA for the SERT in the raphe nucleus were also unaltered by chronic paroxetine treatment. Based on these results, it appears that the SERT is downregulated by chronic administration of SSRIs but not other types of antidepressants; furthermore, the downregulation is not caused by decreases in SERT gene expression.
10580458	Adverse upper gastrointestinal effects of rofecoxib compared with NSAIDs.	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal (GI) toxic effects, such as upper GI tract perforations, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers, and upper GI tract bleeding (PUBs), are thought to be attributable to cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) inhibition. Rofecoxib specifically inhibits COX-2 and has demonstrated a low potential for causing upper GI injury.
10581306	Altered functional properties of KATP channel conferred by a novel splice variant of SUR1.	1. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are composed of pore-forming (Kir6.x) and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SURx) subunits. We have isolated a novel SUR variant (SUR1bDelta33) from a hypothalamic cDNA library. This variant lacked exon 33 and introduced a frameshift that produced a truncated protein lacking the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2). It was expressed at low levels in hypothalamus, midbrain, heart and the insulin-secreting beta-cell line MIN6. 2. We examined the properties of KATP channels composed of Kir6.2 and SUR1bDelta33 by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing these subunits. We also investigated the effect of truncating SUR1 at either the start (SUR1bT1) or end (SUR1bT2) of exon 33 on KATP channel properties. 3. Kir6.2/SUR1bDelta33 showed an enhanced open probability (Po = 0.6 at -60 mV) and a reduced ATP sensitivity (Ki, 86 microM), when compared with wild-type channels (Po = 0.3; Ki, 22 microM). However, Kir6.2/SUR1bT1 and Kir6.2/SUR1bT2 resembled the wild-type channel in their Po and ATP sensitivity. 4. Neither MgADP, nor the K+ channel opener diazoxide, enhanced Kir6.2/SUR1bDelta33, Kir6.2/SUR1bT1 or Kir6.2/SUR1bT2 currents, consistent with the idea that these agents require an intact NBD2 for their action. Sulphonylureas blocked KATP channels containing any of the three SUR variants, but in excised patches the extent of block was less than that for the wild-type channel. In intact cells, the extent of sulphonylurea block of Kir6.2/SUR1bDelta33 was greater than that in excised patches and was comparable to that found for wild-type channels. 5. Our results demonstrate that NBD2 is not essential for functional expression or sulphonylurea block, but is required for KATP channel activation by K+ channel openers and nucleotides. Some of the unusual properties of Kir6.2/SUR1bDelta33 resemble those reported for the KATP channel of ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) neurones, but the fact that this mRNA is expressed at low levels in many other tissues makes it less likely that SUR1bDelta33 serves as the SUR subunit for the VMH KATP channel.
10601100	The effect of etonogestrel on VEGF, oestrogen and progesterone receptor immunoreactivity and endothelial cell number in human endometrium.	Contraceptive use often leads to disrupted endometrial bleeding patterns in women. In this study, two different contraceptive regimes (Mircette, a monophasic oral contraceptive and Implanon, a long-acting gestagen) were used and their effects on the immunoreactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and endothelial cell number were determined. During the untreated normal cycle, there was a significant increase (P = 0.005) in glandular VEGF immunoreactivity and a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in PR immunoreactivity in the mid- and late secretory phases compared with the proliferative phase. There was a significant positive correlation (gamma = 0.38, P = 0.046) between stromal VEGF immunoreactivity and endothelial cell number. This correlation was also apparent during treatment with Implanon, but not with Mircette. Disrupted bleeding patterns were associated with Implanon and, to a lesser extent, with Mircette. Both contraceptives significantly reduced glandular VEGF immunoreactivity. Implanon significantly increased (P = 0.016) glandular PR staining, but Mircette significantly reduced (P = 0.027) stromal PR staining when compared with secretory before-treatment biopsies. There were no changes in endothelial cell number or glandular or stromal ER during the normal cycle, or with use of either contraceptive. There was no association between the parameters measured with bleeding patterns and histological category.
10604939	MCC-134, a novel vascular relaxing agent, is an inverse agonist for the pancreatic-type ATP-sensitive K(+) channel.	The effects of a novel vasorelaxant agent, MCC-134 (1-[4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoyl]-N-methyl-cyclobutanecarbothioamide++ +), were examined on reconstituted ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels, which are composed of an inwardly rectifying K(+) channel, Kir6.2, and three types of sulfonylurea receptors (SUR): SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B. Each type of K(ATP) channel was heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. The expressed K(ATP) channel currents were measured with the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp method. MCC-134 activated the SUR2B/Kir6.2 channel, was a weak activator of the SUR2A/Kir6.2 channel, but did not activate the SUR1/Kir6.2 channel. MCC-134 suppressed SUR1/Kir6.2 channel currents that had been fully activated by either diazoxide or NaCN, whereas it did not affect the fully activated SUR2A/Kir6.2 or SUR2B/Kir6.2 channel currents. Thus, MCC-134, which is a relatively effective opener of the vascular smooth muscle type (SUR2B) of K(ATP) channel, is an antagonist of the pancreatic type (SUR1) of K(ATP) channel. Therefore, depending on the subtype of SUR, a pharmacological agent can cause either activation or inhibition of K(ATP) channel activity.
10606440	Ligand-independent negative chronotropic responses of rat and mouse right atria to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.	Negative chronotropic effects of beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) antagonists on right atria from reserpine-treated rats and mice were determined as a test of their inverse agonist activities. BetaAR antagonist ICI-118,551 and nonselective betaAR antagonists alprenolol, propranolol, and timolol produced negative chronotropic effects. In contrast, nonselective betaAR antagonists pindolol and nadolol as well as beta1AR-selective antagonists atenolol, acebutolol, and metoprolol did not cause a significant decrease in atrial rates. The neutral antagonist pindolol but not the inverse agonist alprenolol inhibited the negative chronotropic activities of ICI-118,551. Isoprenaline, salbutamol, and noradrenaline produced positive chronotropic effects; the chronotropic effects of isoprenaline and salbutamol but not of noradrenaline were antagonized by ICI-118,551. It is concluded that both beta1AR and beta2AR mediate positive chronotropic effects of catecholamines on rat and mouse atria but only beta2AR are constitutively active.
10625393	Transgenic zebrafish for detecting mutations caused by compounds in aquatic environments.	We have established a transgenic zebrafish line carrying a shuttle vector plasmid (pML4) for detecting mutagens in aquatic environments. The plasmid contains the rpsL gene of Escherichia coli as a mutational target gene, and the kanamycin-resistance gene for recovering the plasmid from the chromosomal DNA. To evaluate the system, we treated embryos of the transgenic fish with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), which induces a dose-dependent increase in the mutation frequency of the target gene. The mutation spectrum was consistent with the proposed mechanism of ENU mutagenesis. Similarly, treating the embryos with benzo[a]pyrene or 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5- f]quinoxaline, which are found in naturally polluted water, significantly increased the frequency of mutations in the target gene.
10639181	Biochemically based design of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors: facile conversion of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to potent and highly selective COX-2 inhibitors.	All nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes to different extents, which accounts for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities and their gastrointestinal side effects. We have exploited biochemical differences between the two COX enzymes to identify a strategy for converting carboxylate-containing NSAIDs into selective COX-2 inhibitors. Derivatization of the carboxylate moiety in moderately selective COX-1 inhibitors, such as 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) and arylacetic and fenamic acid NSAIDs, exemplified by indomethacin and meclofenamic acid, respectively, generated potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors. In the indomethacin series, esters and primary and secondary amides are superior to tertiary amides as selective inhibitors. Only the amide derivatives of ETYA and meclofenamic acid inhibit COX-2; the esters are either inactive or nonselective. Inhibition kinetics reveal that indomethacin amides behave as slow, tight-binding inhibitors of COX-2 and that selectivity is a function of the time-dependent step. Site-directed mutagenesis of murine COX-2 indicates that the molecular basis for selectivity differs from the parent NSAIDs and from diarylheterocycles. Selectivity arises from novel interactions at the opening and at the apex of the substrate-binding site. Lead compounds in the present study are potent inhibitors of COX-2 activity in cultured inflammatory cells. Furthermore, indomethacin amides are orally active, nonulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory agents in an in vivo model of acute inflammation. Expansion of this approach can be envisioned for the modification of all carboxylic acid-containing NSAIDs into selective COX-2 inhibitors.
10648647	Molecular determinant of high-affinity dofetilide binding to HERG1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes: involvement of S6 sites.	This study reports that the affinity of HERG1 A for dofetilide is decreased from 0.125 +/- 0.003 microM for wild-type (WT) channels to 15 +/- 3 microM for F656V, a mutation in the COOH-terminal half of the S6. Similarly, the IC(50) for quinidine was increased from 8 +/- 4 microM for WT to 219 +/- 65 microM for the F656V mutation, whereas affinity for external tetraethylammonium was similar for WT (51 +/- 10 mM) and F656V (36 +/- 10 mM, NS). Kinetics of onset of inactivation of F656V was similar to WT but kinetics of deactivation, activation, and recovery from inactivation differed from WT. However, mutations in nearby amino acids in the S6 more strikingly altered deactivation, activation, and recovery from inactivation but had little effect on affinity for dofetilide. To assess the effects of disruption of inactivation, the S631A mutation was made. The S631A mutation altered the IC(50) for dofetilide to 20 +/- 3 microM, but the IC(50) for quinidine was unchanged at 8 +/- 4 microM for WT and 10 +/- 1 microM for S631A. To address whether the F656V mutation alters the IC(50) for dofetilide in a channel that does not inactivate, the double mutation S631A/F656V was made. The IC(50) for dofetilide of the double mutation was 32 +/- 3 microM, which is not substantially different than that of S631A. These data support the notion that allosteric changes occurring during the process of inactivation are necessary for high-affinity dofetilide binding. In conclusion, the Phe-656 residue of HERG is a molecular determinant of high-affinity dofetilide binding.
10651143	Sodium bromide: effects on different patterns of epileptiform activity, extracellular pH changes and GABAergic inhibition.	Results regarding the anticonvulsant potency of bromide have been questioned, and the mechanisms of its action are unclear. Using combined rat hippocampus-entorhinal cortex slices we analyzed the effects of NaBr on four types of epileptiform discharges in two different models of epilepsy, the low-Ca2+ and the low-Mg2+ model. NaBr concentration-dependently reduced the frequency and finally blocked the low Ca2+-induced discharges. Low Mg2+-induced short recurrent discharges were also reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. In the entorhinal cortex the frequency of seizure-like events was reduced by 3 and 5 mM and the discharges were blocked by 7 mM NaBr. Also, the late recurrent discharges in the entorhinal cortex which do not respond to most clinically employed anticonvulsants were reduced by concentrations of 10 and 15 mM and completely blocked by 30 mM NaBr. Using pH-sensitive microelectrodes different effects of NaBr were seen than those of acetazolamide on extracellular pH under control conditions and after stimulation. Acetazolamide at 1 mM caused a reversible acidification of delta pH: 0.2+/-0.14 at rest whereas no change on extracellular pH was seen with 5 mM NaBr. Acetazolamide increased the transient alkalosis induced by repetitive stimulation of the stratum radiatum in area CA1 and reduced the subsequent acidosis. NaBr also increased the alkalosis but had no effect on the subsequent acidosis. A significant increase in paired-pulse inhibition was seen in a paired-pulse stimulation protocol used to monitor the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition at concentrations of 5 mM NaBr. This finding was confirmed in whole-cell patch clamp recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons showing an increase in inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude. In summary, our results suggest a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant activity which is likely to be caused by its effects on membrane excitability, by an increase in GABAergic inhibition and is less likely caused by its effects on extracellular pH.
10651997	The role of specific retinoid receptors in sebocyte growth and differentiation in culture.	Retinoic acid derivatives (retinoids) exert their pleiotropic effects on cell development through specific nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors. Despite recent progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of retinoid activity, it is unknown which of the retinoid receptor pathways are involved in the specific processes of sebocyte growth and development. In this study, we investigated the roles of specific retinoid receptors in sebocyte growth and differentiation, by testing the effects of selective retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor ligands at concentrations between 10-10 M and 10-6 M in a primary rat preputial cell monolayer culture system. Cell growth was determined by number of cells and colonies, and cell differentiation by analysis of lipid-forming colonies. All-trans retinoic acid and selective retinoic acid receptor agonists (CD271 = adapalene, an RAR-beta,gamma agonist; CD2043 = retinoic acid receptor pan-agonist; and CD336 = Am580, an RAR-alpha agonist) caused significant decreases in numbers of cells, colonies, and lipid-forming colonies, but with an exception at high doses of all-trans retinoic acid (10-6 M), with which only a small number of colonies grew but they became twice as differentiated as controls (42.2 +/- 4.0% vs 22.6 +/- 2.7%, mean +/- SEM, lipid-forming colonies, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the RAR-beta,gamma antagonist CD2665 antagonized the suppressive effects of all-trans retinoic acid, adapalene, and CD2043 on both cell growth and differentiation. In contrast, the retinoid X receptor agonist CD2809 increased cell growth slightly and lipid-forming colonies dramatically in a clear dose-related manner to a maximum of 73.7% +/- 6.7% at 10-6 M (p < 0. 001). Our data suggest that retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors differ in their roles in sebocyte growth and differentiation: (i) retinoic acid receptors, especially the beta and/or gamma subtypes, mediate both the antiproliferative and antidifferentiative effects of retinoids; (ii) retinoid X receptors mediate prominent differentiative and weak proliferative effects; (iii) the antiproliferative and antidifferentiative effects of all-trans retinoic acid are probably mediated by retinoic acid receptors, whereas its differentiative effect at high dose may be mediated by retinoid X receptors via all-trans retinoic acid metabolism to 9-cis retinoic acid, the natural ligand of retinoid X receptors.
10657949	Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas.	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is up-regulated in several types of human cancers and has also been directly linked to carcinogenesis. To investigate the role of COX-2 in pancreatic cancer, we evaluated COX-2 protein expression in primary human pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n = 23) and matched normal adjacent tissue (n = 11) by immunoblot analysis. COX-2 expression was found to be significantly elevated in the pancreatic tumor specimens compared with normal pancreatic tissue. To examine whether the elevated levels of COX-2 protein observed in pancreatic tumors correlated with the presence of oncogenic K-ras, we determined the K-ras mutation status in a subset of the tumors and corresponding normal tissues. The presence of oncogenic K-ras did not correlate with the level of COX-2 protein expressed in the pancreatic adenocarcinomas analyzed. These observations were also confirmed in a panel of human pancreatic tumor cell lines. Furthermore, in the pancreatic tumor cell line expressing the highest level of COX-2 (BxPC-3), COX-2 expression was demonstrated to be independent of Erk1/2 activation. The lack of correlation between COX-2 and oncogenic K-ras expression suggests that Ras activation may not be sufficient to induce COX-2 expression in pancreatic tumor cells and that the aberrant activation of signaling pathways other than Ras may be required for up-regulating COX-2 expression. We also report that the COX inhibitors sulindac, indomethacin and NS-398 inhibit cell growth in both COX-2-positive (BxPC-3) and COX-2-negative (PaCa-2) pancreatic tumor cell lines. However, suppression of cell growth by indomethacin and NS-398 was significantly greater in the BxPC-3 cell line compared with the PaCa-2 cell line (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the three COX inhibitors reduce prostaglandin E(2) levels in the BxPC-3 cell line. Taken together, our data suggest that COX-2 may play an important role in pancreatic tumorigenesis and therefore be a promising chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
10673128	Topical rivastigmine, a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, lowers intraocular pressure in rabbits.	Non-selective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are known hypotensive agents. The purpose of the present investigation was carried out to ascertain whether rivastigmine, a selective carbamate-type inhibitor of AChE, which inhibits selectively an isoform of this enzyme found almost exclusively in the central nervous system, is able to depress the intraocular pressure (IOP) in normotensive rabbits. IOP was monitored with a TonoPen XL in conscious adult rabbits before and hourly up to 8 hr after administration of the drug. Baseline measurements without treatment and after one single topical application of rivastigmine [1% (n=8); 2% (n=4); and 5% (n=6)] to the right eye and of the vehicle alone to the left one were performed. Rivastigmine reduced the IOP of treated eyes significantly (p<0.05) in a dose-independent manner. Maximal effects of 23.2% (5% rivastigmine), 19.6% (2% rivastigmine) and 15.2% (1% rivastigmine) were achieved 1, 3 and 5 hr after application of the drug. A non-significant reduction of IOP in the contralateral eye was also observed. Rabbits evidenced no signs of discomfort after administration of rivastigmine. No conjunctival discharge or other signs of drug related local toxicity were found. Rivastigmine, a selective antagonist of AChE, lowers IOP significantly and may thus be of potential use in glaucoma therapy.
10685879	Selective inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters by synthetic local anesthetics.	Synthetic local anesthetics (LAs) have been found to have cocaine-like characteristics with some psychotomimetic action, possibly through monoaminergic neurotransmission. To gain insight into the relation between LA action and monoamine transporters, we investigated the effect of synthetic LAs on neurotransmitter transporters, including monoamine transporters. We used cloned transporter cDNAs and examined transient functional expression in COS cells and stable expression in HeLa cells. Among the LAs tested, procaine and other ester-type LAs inhibited [3H]DA uptake and binding of [3H]2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT), a cocaine analogue, in COS cells expressing rat dopamine transporter (DAT). The inhibition was concentration-dependent. The inhibitory effect on [3H]DA uptake was reversible and not dependent on pH, as observed in HeLa cells stably expressing DAT. Procaine also inhibited uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in COS cells. On the other hand, procaine and other LAs had little or no effect on [3H]GABA and [3H]glutamate uptake in COS cells expressing mouse GABA or rat glutamate/aspartate transporter. IC50 values for [3H]DA uptake inhibition correlated well with those for [3H]CFT binding inhibition, but not with intrinsic anesthetic potency. Kinetic analysis of monoamine uptake inhibition by procaine in COS cells expressing rat DAT, NET or SERT revealed a competitive action similar to that of cocaine. These results demonstrate that certain LAs selectively inhibit monoamine transporters. This might contribute to the cocaine-like psychotomimetic action of certain LAs.
10712445	HERG-Like potassium current regulates the resting membrane potential in glomus cells of the rabbit carotid body.	Direct evidence for a specific K(+) channel underlying the resting membrane potential in glomus cells of the carotid body has been absent. The product of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) produces inward rectifier currents that are known to contribute to the resting membrane potential in other neuronal cells. The goal of the present study was to determine whether carotid body glomus cells express HERG-like K(+) current, and if so, to determine whether a HERG-like current regulates the resting membrane potential. Freshly dissociated rabbit glomus cells under whole cell voltage clamp exhibited slowly decaying outward currents that activated 20-30 mV positive to the resting membrane potential. Raising extracellular K(+) revealed a slowly deactivating inward tail current indicative of HERG-like K(+) current. HERG-like currents were not found in cells resembling type II cells. The HERG-like current was blocked by dofetilide (DOF) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 13 +/- 4 nM, mean +/- SE) and high concentrations of Ba(2+) (1 and 10 mM). The biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of this inward tail current suggest that it is conducted by a HERG-like channel. The steady-state activation properties of the HERG-like current (V(h) = -44 +/- 2 mV) suggest that it is active at the resting membrane potential in glomus cells. In whole cell, current-clamped glomus cells (average resting membrane potential, - 48 +/- 4 mV), DOF, but not tetraethylammonium, caused a significant (13 mV) depolarizing shift in the resting membrane potential. Using fluorescence imaging, DOF increased [Ca(2+)](i) in isolated glomus cells. In an in-vitro carotid body preparation, DOF increased basal sensory discharge in the carotid sinus nerve in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that glomus cells express a HERG-like current that is active at, and responsible for controlling the resting membrane potential.
10713582	Lack of adverse pharmacodynamic drug interactions with rivastigmine and twenty-two classes of medications.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often associated with multiple comorbidities and subsequent polypharmacy. Treatment of AD with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors can carry a risk of drug interaction with multiple medications often prescribed for other co-existing illnesses. Rivastigmine is an AChE inhibitor that is enzymatically cleaved by AChE, minimally metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, has low protein binding, has a short plasma half-life, and a relatively short duration of action. Such properties make it ideal for use in this patient population. A pharmacodynamic analysis of rivastigmine administered concomitantly with other medications (22 different therapeutic classes) did not reveal any significant pattern of increase in adverse events that would indicate a drug interaction. In summary, rivastigmine was well tolerated and safely administered to a population receiving multiple medications for 'real-world' comorbidities.
10727523	Interactions of the human multidrug resistance proteins MRP1 and MRP2 with organic anions.	The human multidrug resistance protein MRP1 and its homolog, MRP2, are both suggested as being involved in cancer drug resistance and the transport of organic anions. We expressed MRP1 and MRP2 in Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells and compared their ATP-dependent transport properties and vanadate-sensitive ATPase activities in isolated membrane vesicles. Both MRP1 and MRP2 actively transported leukotriene C(4) and N-ethylmaleimide glutathione (NEM-GS), although the relative affinity of MRP2 for these substrates was found to be significantly lower than that of MRP1. Methotrexate was actively transported by both proteins, although more efficiently by MRP2. ATP-dependent NEM-GS transport by MRP1 and MRP2 was variably modulated by organic anions. Probenecid and furosemide inhibited, whereas under certain conditions sulfinpyrazone, penicillin G, and indomethacin greatly stimulated, MRP2-mediated NEM-GS uptake. Vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in isolated membranes containing MRP1 or MRP2 was significantly stimulated by NEM-GS and reduced GS, although these compounds acted only at higher concentrations in MRP2. ATP hydrolysis by MRP2 was also effectively stimulated by methotrexate. Probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, indomethacin, furosemide, and penicillin G all significantly increased MRP2-ATPase activity, whereas these compounds acted more as ATPase inhibitors on MRP1. These results indicate that MRP1 is a more efficient transporter of glutathione conjugates and free glutathione than MRP2, whereas several anions are preferred substrates for MRP2. Our data suggest that MRP2 may be responsible for the active secretion of pharmacologically relevant organic anions, such as diuretics and antibiotics, and indicate different modulation possibilities for MRP1 or MRP2 in drug-resistant tumor cells.
10741458	Evidence for a noncholinergic function of acetylcholinesterase during development of chicken retina as shown by fasciculin.	Fasciculin 2 (FAS), an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) peripheral site ligand that inhibits mammalian AChE in the picomolar range and chicken AChE only at micromolar concentrations, was used in chick retinal cell cultures to evaluate the influence of AChE on neuronal development. The effects of other AChE inhibitors that bind the active and/or the peripheral site of the enzyme [paraoxon, eserine, or 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl) pentan-3-one dibromide (BW284c51)] were also studied. Morphological changes of cultured neurons were observed with the drugs used and in the different cell culture systems studied. Cell aggregates size decreased by more than 35% in diameter after 9 days of FAS treatment, mainly due to reduction in the presumptive plexiform area of the aggregates. Eserine showed no effect on the morphology of the aggregates, although it fully inhibited the activity of AChE. In dense stationary cell culture, cluster formation increased after 3 days and 6 days of FAS treatment. However, FAS, at concentrations in which changes of morphological parameters were observed, did not inhibit the AChE activity as measured histochemically. In contrast, paraoxon treatment produced a slight morphological alteration of the cultures, while a strong inhibition of enzyme activity caused by this agent was observed. BW284c51 showed a harmful, probably toxic effect, also causing a slight AChE inhibition. It is suggested that the effect of an anticholinesterase agent on the morphological modifications of cultured neurons is not necessarily associated with the intensity of the AChE inhibition, especially in the case of FAS. Moreover, most of the effects of AChE on culture morphology appear to be independent of the cholinolytic activity of the enzyme. The results obtained demonstrate that FAS is not toxic for the cells and suggest that regions of the AChE molecule related to the enzyme peripheral site are likely to be involved with the nonclassical role of AChE.
10742172	The structure of the ferric siderophore binding protein FhuD complexed with gallichrome.	Siderophore binding proteins play a key role in the uptake of iron in many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. FhuD is a soluble periplasmic binding protein that transports ferrichrome and other hydroxamate siderophores. The crystal structure of FhuD from Escherichia coli in complex with the ferrichrome homolog gallichrome has been determined at 1.9 ¿ resolution, the first structure of a periplasmic binding protein involved in the uptake of siderophores. Gallichrome is held in a shallow pocket lined with aromatic groups; Arg and Tyr side chains interact directly with the hydroxamate moieties of the siderophore. FhuD possesses a novel fold, suggesting that its mechanisms of ligand binding and release are different from other structurally characterized periplasmic ligand binding proteins.
10753628	Stimulation by eicosapentaenoic acids of leptin mRNA expression and its secretion in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro.	Recent evidence indicates that both leptin and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) improve insulin sensitivity. In the present study, we examined the effect of EPA on endogenous leptin expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to clarify whether the EPA's effect is exerted through leptin expression. EPA caused a time- and dose-dependent increase of leptin mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Leptin mRNA expression was significantly increased up to 309.4 +/- 17.0% of the control by 24 h (P < 0.01; n = 6). Leptin secretion was also significantly increased up to 193.3 +/- 12.1% of the control by 24 h (P < 0.01; n = 6). EPA is a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) with the highest affinity to PPARalpha. We examined the effect on leptin expression of clofibrate, a ligand for PPARalpha, bezafibrate, for PPARbeta, or troglitazone, for PPARgamma, to clarify whether these ligands for PPARs could mimic EPA-induced stimulation of leptin expression. Neither clofibrate nor bezafibrate affected leptin mRNA expression, whereas troglitazone significantly suppressed leptin mRNA expression. On the other hand, inhibition by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine of the rate-limiting enzyme in hexosamine biosynthesis blunted EPA-induced stimulation of leptin mRNA expression and its secretion. These data suggest that EPA up-regulates leptin gene expression and its secretion probably through a hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.
10755318	N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy] ethanamine (DPPE) a chemopotentiating and cytoprotective agent in clinical trials: interaction with histamine at cytochrome P450 3A4 and other isozymes that metabolize antineoplastic drugs.	N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl (DPPE), an intracellular histamine (HA) antagonist with chemopotentiating and cytoprotective properties, is currently in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in breast and prostate cancer. DPPE modulates growth at in vitro concentrations that antagonize HA binding to cytochromes P450 in rat liver microsomes. HA inhibits P450 metabolism of some drugs. Recent in vitro studies in human colon cancer cells have linked DPPE enhancement of paclitaxel, doxorubicin and vinblastine cytotoxicity to inhibition of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump. Many substrates of P-gp are also substrates of CYP3A4, a P450 isozyme that metabolizes a variety of antineoplastic agents and is highly expressed in some malignant tissues. Therefore, we assessed whether (a) DPPE and HA interact at CYP3A4 and other P450 human isozymes, and (b) DPPE inhibits the catalytic activity of CYP3A4.
10758053	Effects of flecainide in patients with new SCN5A mutation: mutation-specific therapy for long-QT syndrome?	Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) can cause one variant of the congenital long-QT syndrome. The effects of some of these mutations on the alpha-subunit channel properties can be blocked by type Ib antiarrhythmic drugs. Recently, we have described a new SCN5A mutation (D1790G) that affects the channel properties in a manner suggesting that sodium blockers of the Ib type will be ineffective in carriers of this mutation. Hence, the ECG effects of flecainide-acetate, a type Ic sodium blocker, were evaluated in carriers of this mutation.
10762042	Potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: design, synthesis and structure-activity relationships of alkylene linked bis-galanthamine and galanthamine-galanthaminium salts.	The syntheses, the anticholinesterase activities and structure-activity relationships of homodimeric (3a-c) and heterodimeric (6a-c) alkylene linked bis-galanthamine are reported. Compounds 6b-c were found to be more potent than galanthamine and tacrine in inhibiting AChE.
10762666	High affinity blockade of the HERG cardiac K(+) channel by the neuroleptic pimozide.	Pimozide is an antipsychotic agent also used to treat facial tics. Pimozide can cause acquired long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. To elucidate the mechanism behind these clinical findings, we examined the effects of pimozide on the cloned human cardiac K(+) channels HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene; rapid component of delayed rectifier), Kv1.5 (ultra-rapid delayed rectifier) and KvLQT1/minK (slow component of delayed rectifier). Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that pimozide was a potent inhibitor of HERG displaying an IC(50) value of 18 nM. In contrast, pimozide (10 microM) was a weak inhibitor of KvLQT1/minK and Kv1.5. We conclude that pimozide is a specific, high affinity antagonist of HERG, and that this interaction leads to prolongation of cardiac repolarization.
10764590	Ligand-induced stabilization of PPARgamma monitored by NMR spectroscopy: implications for nuclear receptor activation.	Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are mediators of the action of lipophilic hormones and other endogenous ligands and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of therapeutic areas. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma is a nuclear receptor that, acting as a heterodimer with RXR, mediates a variety of cellular effects including adipocyte-differentiation. Due to its role in modulating insulin sensitivity, it is the target of therapeutically active anti-diabetic agents such as rosiglitazone. We have assigned the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms of the 32 kDa ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma in the presence of bound rosiglitazone. Three-dimensional HNCO spectra of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) have less than half the expected number of cross-peaks. The missing cross-peaks are restored upon binding strong agonists such as rosiglitazone. The NMR results indicate that the apo-LBD of PPARgamma is in a conformationally mobile state, and that agonist binding is associated with a marked stabilization of the conformation. Mapping the missing peaks to the 3D X-ray crystallographic structure indicates the region of mobility is extensive and includes the ligand-binding region and the cofactor-binding site. This leads to the conclusion that activation of this nuclear receptor is a result of a population shift of a dynamic ensemble of conformations, rather than a two-state switch from an inactive to an active conformation. Our results have important implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists of nuclear receptor function operate.
10766749	Mimosine is a cell-specific antagonist of folate metabolism.	Iron deficiency and iron chelators are known to alter folate metabolism in mammals, but the underlying biochemical mechanisms have not been established. Although many studies have demonstrated that the iron chelators mimosine and deferoxamine inhibit DNA replication in mammalian cells, their mechanism of action remains controversial. The effects of mimosine on folate metabolism were investigated in human MCF-7 cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. Our findings indicate that mimosine is a folate antagonist and that its effects are cell-specific. MCF-7 cells cultured in the presence of 350 microm mimosine were growth-arrested, whereas mimosine had no effect on SH-SY5Y cell proliferation. Mimosine altered the distribution of folate cofactor forms in MCF-7 cells, indicating that mimosine targets folate metabolism. However, mimosine does not influence folate metabolism in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. The effect of mimosine on folate metabolism is associated with decreased cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) expression in MCF-7 cells but not in SH-SY5Y cells. MCF-7 cells exposed to mimosine for 24 h have a 95% reduction in cSHMT protein, and cSHMT promoter activity is reduced over 95%. Transcription of the cSHMT gene is also inhibited by deferoxamine in MCF-7 cells, indicating that mimosine inhibits cSHMT transcription by chelating iron. Analyses of mimosine-resistant MCF-7 cell lines demonstrate that although the effect of mimosine on cell cycle is independent of its effects on cSHMT expression, it inhibits both processes through a common regulatory mechanism.
10770198	Differential regulation by troglitazone of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 in human hepatic and vascular cells.	Troglitazone, a novel oral insulin sensitizer, normalizes increased plasma activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in hyperinsulinemic patients such as women with polycystic ovary syndrome and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Human hepatic and vascular cells, the main sources of circulating PAI-1, were studied in cell culture. In human hepatic cells, PAI-1 accumulated in conditioned medium by 23% within 24 h after exposure to 3 microg/mL troglitazone (P = 0.001). The accumulation depended on the concentration of troglitazone, but not that of insulin (known to stimulate PAI-1 synthesis). By contrast, in human aortic smooth muscle cells, 3 microg/mL troglitazone decreased basal PAI-1 expression by 23% (P = 0.037) and decreased transforming growth factor-beta-induced expression by 34% (P = 0.026). Concomitant insulin had no effect. Tissue-type plasminogen activator was decreased by 38% (P = 0.002). In human endothelial cells, PAI-1 was diminished by 32% (P < 0.001), whereas tissue-type plasminogen activator was unaffected. The results suggest that the reduction in plasma activity of PAI-1 induced by troglitazone in patients may reflect both directly mediated diminution of its elaboration from vessel walls and indirectly mediated reduction of its hepatic synthesis secondary to attenuation of hyperinsulinemia (known to increase the hepatic synthesis of PAI-1).
10773011	Cyclooxygenase-2 contributes to N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated neuronal cell death in primary cortical cell culture.	Cyclooxygenase isozymes (COX-1 and COX-2) are found to be constitutively expressed in brain, with neuronal expression of COX-2 being rapidly induced after numerous insults, including cerebral ischemia. Because overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been implicated in the cell loss associated with ischemia, we characterized the expression of the COX isozymes in murine mixed cortical cell cultures and used isozyme-selective inhibitors to determine their relative contribution to NMDA receptor-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) production and excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Immunocytochemical analysis of mixed cortical cell cultures revealed that COX-2 expression was restricted to neurons, whereas COX-1 was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Brief exposure to NMDA (5 min; 100 microM) elicited a time-dependent accumulation of PGs in the culture medium that preceded neuronal cell death and correlated with the induction of COX-2 mRNA. COX-1 expression remained unchanged. Flurbiprofen, a nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, blocked NMDA-stimulated PG production and attenuated neuronal death in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (10-30 microM) but not with the selective COX-1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate (10-300 microM). Inhibition of total constitutive COX activity with aspirin (100 microM, 1.5 h) before NMDA exposure did not prevent subsequent NMDA-mediated neuronal cell death. However, neuronal injury in aspirin-pretreated cultures was attenuated by flurbiprofen administration after NMDA exposure. Finally, the protection afforded by COX-2 inhibition was specific for NMDA because neither flurbiprofen nor NS-398 protected neurons against kainate-mediated neurotoxicity. Together, these results support the conclusion that newly synthesized COX-2 protein contributes to NMDA-induced neuronal injury.
10773014	Pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel activity and membrane-binding studies with nateglinide: A comparison with sulfonylureas and repaglinide.	Nateglinide (A-4166) is an amino acid derivative with insulinotrophic action in clinical development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether nateglinide's interaction at the K(ATP) channel/sulfonylurea receptor underlies its more rapid onset and shorter duration of action in animal models. Binding studies were carried out with membranes prepared from RIN-m5F cells and HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant human sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). The relative order for displacement of [(3)H]glibenclamide in competitive binding experiments with RIN-m5F cell membranes was glibenclamide > glimepiride > repaglinide > glipizide > nateglinide > L-nateglinide > tolbutamide. The results with HEK-293/recombinant human SUR1 cells were similar with the exception that glipizide was more potent than repaglinide. Neither nateglinide nor repaglinide had any effect on the dissociation kinetics for [(3)H]glibenclamide, consistent with both compounds competitively binding to the glibenclamide-binding site on SUR1. Finally, the inability to measure [(3)H]nateglinide binding suggests that nateglinide dissociates rapidly from SUR1. Direct interaction of nateglinide with K(ATP) channels in rat pancreatic beta-cells was investigated with the patch-clamp method. The relative potency for inhibition of the K(ATP) channel was repaglinide > glibenclamide > nateglinide. Kinetics of the inhibitory effect on K(ATP) current showed that the onset of inhibition by nateglinide was comparable to glibenclamide but more rapid than that of repaglinide. The time for reversal of channel inhibition by nateglinide was also faster than with glibenclamide and repaglinide. These results suggest that the unique characteristics of nateglinide are largely the result of its interaction at the K(ATP) channel.
10787442	Involvement of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in regulating long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases.	Long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the corresponding free fatty acid and CoA. We recently cloned four members of a novel multi-gene family of peroxisome proliferator-induced genes encoding cytosolic (CTE-I), mitochondrial (MTE-I), and peroxisomal (PTE-Ia and PTE-Ib) acyl-CoA thioesterases (Hunt et al. 1999. J. Biol. Chem. 274: 34317-34326). As the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) plays a central role in regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism, we examined the involvement of this receptor in regulation of the thioesterases, particularly CTE-I and MTE-I. Northern blot analysis shows that the induction of these thioesterases by clofibrate is mediated through a strictly PPARalpha-dependent mechanism. All four acyl-CoA thioesterases are induced at mRNA level by fasting and using PPARalpha-null mice, it is evident that the increase in CTE-I due to fasting is mainly independent of the PPARalpha in liver and heart. The CTE-I gene responds rapidly to fasting, with induction of mRNA and protein evident after 6 h. This fasting effect is rapidly reversible, with CTE-I mRNA returning almost to control levels after 3 h refeeding, and being further repressed to 20% of control after 9 h refeeding. Although CTE-I mRNA shows a low basal expression in liver, it can be suppressed 90% by feeding a fat-free diet. These data demonstrate that the nutritional regulation of the thioesterases involves the PPARalpha and other signaling pathways responsible for activation and repression. Putative physiological functions for the acyl-CoA thioesterases are discussed.
10793196	Agents which block potassium-chloride cotransport prevent sound-triggered seizures in post-ischemic audiogenic seizure-prone rats.	The purpose of this study was to determine whether the loop diuretics furosemide, bumetanide and ethacrynic acid, which block the KCC1 potassium-chloride transporter in the kidney loop of Henle and the KCC2 potassium-chloride transporter in neuronal membranes, would prevent sound-triggered seizures in post-ischemic audiogenic seizure-prone rats. The rats were infused with the test agent via tail vein shortly before being tested for seizure susceptibility by exposure to loud noise (an alarm bell) for 60 s. Sound exposures were repeated at intervals to determine the time course of the seizure suppression effect. All three loop diuretics suppressed sound-triggered seizures in post-ischemic rats tested 2 days to 4 weeks after the ischemic exposure. Furosemide 200 mg/kg had no effect in 4/4 rats made acutely audiogenic seizure-prone by infusion of bicuculline into the inferior colliculus, indicating that the effect was not due to general anti-seizure activity. Mannitol 2 g/kg had no effect in 6/6 post-ischemic rats, indicating that the effect was not due to diuresis or fluid shifts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the exposure to global ischemia caused an upregulation of the potassium-chloride transporter KCC2 in neurons which persisted for at least 4 weeks.
10799317	Fenofibrate and rosiglitazone lower serum triglycerides with opposing effects on body weight.	Activators of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are effective drugs to improve the metabolic abnormalities linking hypertriglyceridemia to diabetes, hyperglycemia, insulin-resistance, and atherosclerosis. We compared the pharmacological profile of a PPARalpha activator, fenofibrate, and a PPARgamma activator, rosiglitazone, on serum parameters, target gene expression, and body weight gain in (fa/fa) fatty Zucker rats and db/db mice as well as their association in db/db mice. Fenofibrate faithfully modified the expression of PPARalpha responsive genes. Rosiglitazone increased adipose tissue aP2 mRNA in both models while increasing liver acyl CoA oxidase mRNA in db/db mice but not in fatty Zucker rats. Both drugs lowered serum triglycerides yet rosiglitazone markedly increased body weight gain while fenofibrate decreased body weight gain in fatty Zucker rats. KRP 297, which has been reported to be a PPARalpha and gamma co-activator, also affected serum triglycerides and insulin in fatty Zucker rats although no change in body weight gain was noted. These results serve to clearly differentiate the metabolic finality of two distinct classes of drugs, as well as their corresponding nuclear receptors, having similar effects on serum triglycerides.
10799660	Characterization of phentermine and related compounds as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.	Phentermine was shown in the 1970s to inhibit the metabolism of serotonin by monoamine oxidase (MAO), but never was labeled as an MAO inhibitor; hence, it was widely used in combination with fenfluramine, and continues to be used, in violation of their labels, with other serotonin uptake blockers. We examined the effects of phentermine and several other unlabeled MAO inhibitors on MAO activities in rat lung, brain, and liver, and also the interactions of such drugs when administered together. Rat tissues were assayed for MAO-A and -B, using serotonin and beta-phenylethylamine as substrates. Phentermine inhibited serotonin-metabolizing (MAO-A) activity in all three tissues with K(i) values of 85-88 microM. These potencies were similar to those of the antidepressant MAO inhibitors iproniazid and moclobemide. When phentermine was mixed with other unlabeled reversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, norephedrine; estradiol benzoate), the degree of MAO inhibition was additive. The cardiac valvular lesions and primary pulmonary hypertension that have been reported to be associated with fenfluramine-phentermine use may have resulted from the intermittent concurrent blockage of both serotonin uptake and metabolism.
10805052	Comparison of the AT1-receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, and the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, in fixed combination with low dose hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients.	To compare candesartan cilexetil and lisinopril in fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide with respect to antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability.
10814558	Stressful manipulations that elevate corticosterone reduce blood-brain barrier permeability to pyridostigmine in the Rat.	Pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), is used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. PB has also been provided to military personnel for preexposure protection against potential soman release. The entry of PB into the brain is typically minimal, but recently published data in mice suggest that a brief forced swim stress increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to PB. From these results, PB administered under stressful conditions was proposed to induce long-lasting central cholinergic deficits, potentially explaining the neurological and neuropsychological symptoms presented by some Gulf War veterans. In undertaking to replicate these results in the Long-Evans rat, no evidence of a stress-potentiated central effect of PB, administered at doses up 5.0 mg/kg ip, was found. Three stress protocols were used: restraint, forced swim, or a combined restraint/forced swim. Wistar rats were also tested in some of the protocols to ensure that the results were generalizable across rat strains, and plasma corticosterone levels were measured to test the effectiveness of the stressors employed. In contrast to the previously reported findings in the mouse, stress significantly reduced the entry of PB into rat brain, as measured by reduced inhibition of AChE activity: a 12.5% reduction in whole brain AChE activity after treatment with 5.0 mg/kg PB under control conditions declined to 9% after stress exposure. It is apparent, therefore, that the interaction between stress and PB requires further study, and previous data should be reassessed before they are used as a basis for interpreting symptoms presented by veterans.
10815932	Antitumor effect and potentiation of cytotoxic drugs activity in human cancer cells by ZD-1839 (Iressa), an epidermal growth factor receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor.	Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) is an autocrine growth factor for human cancer. Overexpression of TGF-alpha and its specific receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. The EGFR has been proposed as a target for anticancer therapy. Compounds that block ligand-induced EGFR activation have been developed. ZD-1839 (Iressa) is a p.o.-active, quinazoline derivative that selectively inhibits the EGFR tyrosine kinase and is under clinical development in cancer patients. The antiproliferative activity of ZD-1839 alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs differing in mechanism(s) of action, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, topotecan, and raltitrexed, was evaluated in human ovarian (OVCAR-3), breast (ZR-75-1, MCF-10A ras), and colon cancer (GEO) cells that coexpress EGFR and TGF-alpha. ZD-1839 inhibited colony formation in soft agar in a dose-dependent manner in all cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative effect was mainly cytostatic. However, treatment with higher doses resulted in a 2-4-fold increase in apoptosis. A dose-dependent supra-additive increase in growth inhibition was observed when cancer cells were treated with each cytotoxic drug and ZD-1839. The combined treatment markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death induced by single-agent treatment. ZD-1839 treatment of nude mice bearing established human GEO colon cancer xenografts revealed a reversible dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth because GEO tumors resumed the growth rate of controls at the end of the treatment. In contrast, the combined treatment with a cytotoxic agent, such as topotecan, raltitrexed, or paclitaxel, and ZD-1839 produced tumor growth arrest in all mice. Tumors grew slowly for approximately 4-8 weeks after the end of treatment, when they finally resumed a growth rate similar to controls. GEO tumors reached a size not compatible with normal life in all control mice within 4-6 weeks and in all single agent-treated mice within 6-8 weeks after GEO cell injection. In contrast, 50% of mice treated with ZD-1839 plus topotecan, raltitrexed, or paclitaxel were still alive 10, 12, and 15 weeks after cancer cell injection, respectively. These results demonstrate the antitumor effect of this EGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor and provide a rationale for its clinical evaluation in combination with cytotoxic drugs.
10821438	Differential effects of subchronic treatments with atypical antipsychotic drugs on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the rat brain.	The effects of 3-week treatment with a typical antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine and three atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine and perospirone) on the binding to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors were examined in the rat stratum and frontal cortex, respectively. Subchronic treatment with chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg) and perospirone (1 mg/kg) significantly increased D2 receptors, while no increase was observed with lower dose of chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg), perospirone (0.1 mg/kg), risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1, 2 mg/kg). On the other hand, 3-week administration of chlorpromazine (5, 10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (1, 2 mg/kg) significantly decreased 5-HT2A receptors, but risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or perospirone (0.1, 1 mg/kg) had no effect. The measurement of in vivo drug occupation for D2 and 5-HT2A receptors using N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) suggested that high occupation of 5-HT2A receptors with lower D2 receptor occupancy might be involved in the absence of up-regulation of D2 receptors after subchronic treatment with some atypical antipsychotic drugs.
10823899	Amphetamine-induced loss of human dopamine transporter activity: an internalization-dependent and cocaine-sensitive mechanism.	The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a target of amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. These psychostimulants attenuate DAT clearance efficiency, thereby increasing synaptic dopamine (DA) levels. Re-uptake rate is determined by the number of functional transporters at the cell surface as well as by their turnover rate. Here, we present evidence that DAT substrates, including AMPH and DA, cause internalization of human DAT, thereby reducing transport capacity. Acute treatment with AMPH reduced the maximal rate of [(3)H]DA uptake, decreased AMPH-induced currents, and significantly redistributed the immunofluorescence of an epitope-tagged DAT from the plasma membrane to the cytosol in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Conversely, DAT inhibitors, such as cocaine, mazindol, and nomifensine, when administered with AMPH, blocked the reduction in [(3)H]DA uptake and the redistribution of DAT immunofluorescence to the cytosol. The reductions of [(3)H]DA uptake and AMPH-induced DAT internalization also were inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin I (K44A), indicating that endocytosis modulates transport capacity, likely through a clathrin-mediated pathway. With this mechanism of regulation, acute application of AMPH would reduce DA uptake not only by direct competition for uptake, but also by reducing the available cell-surface DAT. Moreover, AMPH-induced internalization might diminish the amount of DAT available for DA efflux, thereby modulating the cytotoxic effects of elevated extracellular DA.
10824628	Pharmacokinetic interaction between verapamil and almotriptan in healthy volunteers.	To assess the interaction between almotriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonist used to treat migraine, and verapamil, an agent for migraine prophylaxis.
10826401	Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade in hypertensive women: benefits of candesartan cilexetil versus enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide.	The aim of this large, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in hypertensive women was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and effects on subjective symptoms and quality of life of the new angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Women, aged 40 to 69 years, with a seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 115 mm Hg, were randomized to candesartan cilexetil, 8 to 16 mg (n = 140), enalapril, 10 to 20 mg (n = 146), or HCTZ, 12.5 to 25 mg (n = 143), for 12 weeks; the higher doses were used if DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg after 6 weeks. Candesartan cilexetil lowered seated blood pressure by 17/11 and 19/11 mm Hg after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. This reduction was greater (P < .01) than with enalapril (12/8 and 13/9 mm Hg) or HCTZ (12/7 and 13/8 mm Hg). The proportions of patients with controlled DBP (< 90 mm Hg) after 12 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil, enalapril, or HCTZ were 60%, 51%, and 43%, respectively. Patients experienced less dry cough (P < 0.001) with candesartan cilexetil or HCTZ than with enalapril. No treatment differences were found in the incidence of dizziness and quality of life was well maintained in all groups. Compared with candesartan cilexetil and enalapril, HCTZ increased uric acid and decreased serum potassium (P < .001). In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil reduced blood pressure more effectively and was better tolerated than enalapril or HCTZ in women with mild to moderate hypertension.
10828060	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activators improve insulin sensitivity and reduce adiposity.	Fibrates and glitazones are two classes of drugs currently used in the treatment of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR), respectively. Whereas glitazones are insulin sensitizers acting via activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype, fibrates exert their lipid-lowering activity via PPARalpha. To determine whether PPARalpha activators also improve insulin sensitivity, we measured the capacity of three PPARalpha-selective agonists, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate, and the new compound GW9578, in two rodent models of high fat diet-induced (C57BL/6 mice) or genetic (obese Zucker rats) IR. At doses yielding serum concentrations shown to activate selectively PPARalpha, these compounds markedly lowered hyperinsulinemia and, when present, hyperglycemia in both animal models. This effect relied on the improvement of insulin action on glucose utilization, as indicated by a lower insulin peak in response to intraperitoneal glucose in ciprofibrate-treated IR obese Zucker rats. In addition, fenofibrate treatment prevented high fat diet-induced increase of body weight and adipose tissue mass without influencing caloric intake. The specificity for PPARalpha activation in vivo was demonstrated by marked alterations in the expression of PPARalpha target genes, whereas PPARgamma target gene mRNA levels did not change in treated animals. These results indicate that compounds with a selective PPARalpha activation profile reduce insulin resistance without having adverse effects on body weight and adipose tissue mass in animal models of IR.
10831180	Improvement by the insulin-sensitizing agent, troglitazone, of abnormal fibrinolysis in type 2 diabetes mellitus.	This study evaluated abnormal fibrinolysis in diabetic patients in terms of the pathophysiological significance and reversibility by oral hypoglycemic agents. Forty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly treated for 4 weeks with glibenclamide (n = 23) or troglitazone (n = 24). Before and after treatment, glycemic control, steady-state plasma glucose and insulin (SSPG and SSPI, respectively), and markers of fibrinolysis (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) were analyzed in each patient. Pretreatment plasma PAI-1 in diabetic patients, but not tPA, was well correlated with the severity of retinopathy assessed by the fluorescence technique. Four weeks of treatment with troglitazone significantly decreased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), SSPG, and PAI-1 without an alteration of tPA. The troglitazone-induced decrease in plasma PAI-1 (50.3 v28.8 micromol/L; P < .05) was correlated with HbA1c (8.80% v7.21%, r = .539, P < .01) and SSPG (16.2 v 8.97 mmol/L, r = .562, P < .01) but not with SSPI. In contrast, treatment with glibenclamide for 4 weeks also reduced the HbA1c titer to almost the same extent as troglitazone (1.38% v 1.59%), but did not change the plasma PAI-1 or SSPG titer. These results suggest that an abnormal fibrinolytic state, especially overproduction of PAI-1, may be a pathogenic factor in the development of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, which may be improved by correction of the insulin resistance with troglitazone.
10836199	Induction of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta activities by synthetic progestins.	The cellular action of steroid hormones is mediated by specific receptors. Recently, two different estrogen receptors (ER), alpha and beta, have been cloned with a specific tissue distribution. Active estrogen as well as active progestin are compounds of oral hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. To examine the regulation of ER-alpha and -beta activities after treatment with synthetic progestins and synthetic and natural estrogens, COS 7 cells were transfected with the vector expressing ER-alpha and -beta in combination with a luciferase reporter vector. ER-alpha activity was upregulated in the presence of synthetic progestins in a dose-dependent manner. Norethisterone, norethynodrel and desogestrel proved to be the most potent stimulatory agents of ER-alpha expression. On the other hand, not all progestins exhibited a stimulatory action on ER-beta activity. Only norgestrel, levonorgestrel, norethynodrel and norethisterone induced ER-beta-activating functions in a dose-dependent manner. Luciferase activity due to estrogen stimulation served as a positive control. Our results indicate that progestins have different effects on the activities of ER-alpha and -beta.
10841524	Na(+)-dependent transporters mediate HCO(3)(-) salvage across the luminal membrane of the main pancreatic duct.	To study the roles of Na(+)-dependent H(+) transporters, we characterized H(+) efflux mechanisms in the pancreatic duct in wild-type, NHE2(-/-), and NHE3(-/-) mice. The pancreatic duct expresses NHE1 in the basolateral membrane, and NHE2 and NHE3 in the luminal membrane, but does not contain NHE4 or NHE5. Basolateral Na(+)-dependent H(+) efflux in the microperfused duct was inhibited by 1.5 microM of the amiloride analogue HOE 694, consistent with expression of NHE1, whereas the luminal activity required 50 microM HOE 694 for effective inhibition, suggesting that the efflux might be mediated by NHE2. However, disruption of NHE2 had no effect on luminal transport, while disruption of the NHE3 gene reduced luminal Na(+)-dependent H(+) efflux by approximately 45%. Notably, the remaining luminal Na(+)-dependent H(+) efflux in ducts from NHE3(-/-) mice was inhibited by 50 microM HOE 694. Hence, approximately 55% of luminal H(+) efflux (or HCO(3)(-) influx) in the pancreatic duct is mediated by a novel, HOE 694-sensitive, Na(+)-dependent mechanism. H(+) transport by NHE3 and the novel transporter is inhibited by cAMP, albeit to different extents. We propose that multiple Na(+)-dependent mechanisms in the luminal membrane of the pancreatic duct absorb Na(+) and HCO(3)(-) to produce a pancreatic juice that is poor in HCO(3)(-) and rich in Cl(-) during basal secretion. Inhibition of the transporters during stimulated secretion aids in producing the HCO(3)(-)-rich pancreatic juice.
10856732	Improvement of cardiac output in patients with severe heart failure by use of ACE-inhibitors combined with the AT1-antagonist eprosartan.	The efficacy of ACE-inhibitor therapy is well documented in the treatment of chronic heart failure. As pharmacological mechanisms of ACE-inhibition and angiotensin II AT1-receptor-antagonists differ, an additional positive effect concerning left ventricular function can be expected in combining both classes of drugs.
10860024	Effects of calcium channel blockers on cloned cardiac K+ channels IKr and IKs.	Cloned HERG and KvLQT1-IsK K+ channels have been expressed in mammalian cells and assayed as a target for calcium channel blockers. These channels generate the rapid and slow components of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, and mutations can affect them that lead to long QT syndromes. HERG is blocked by bepridil (EC50 = 0.55 microM), verapamil (EC50 = 0.83 microM) and mibefradil (EC50 = 1.43 microM), whereas nitrendipine and diltiazem have negligible effects. Steady-state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more negative values in the presence of the blockers. Similarly, KvLQT1-IsK is inhibited by bepridil (EC50 = 10.0 microM) and mibefradil (EC50 = 11.8 microM), whilst being insensitive to nitrendipine, diltiazem or verapamil. This work may help to understand the mechanisms of action of verapamil in certain ventricular tachycardias as well as some of the deleterious adverse cardiac events associated with bepridil and mibefradil.
10869387	Transporter-mediated release: a superfusion study on human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the human serotonin transporter.	HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) were grown on coverslips, preincubated with [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and superfused. Substrates of the hSERT [e.g., p-chloroamphetamine (PCA)], increased the basal efflux of [(3)H]5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner. 5-HT reuptake blockers (e.g., imipramine, paroxetine) also raised [(3)H]5-HT efflux, reaching approximately one-third of the maximal effect of the hSERT substrates. In uptake experiments, both groups of substances inhibited [(3)H]5-HT uptake. Using the low-affinity substrate [(3)H]N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) to label the cells in superfusion experiments, reuptake inhibitors failed to enhance efflux. Similar results were obtained using human placental choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells that constitutively express the hSERT at a low level. By contrast, PCA raised [(3)H]MPP(+) efflux in both types of cells, and its effect was inhibited by paroxetine. The addition of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (100 microM) to the superfusion buffer enhanced basal efflux of [(3)H]5-HT-loaded hSERT cells by approximately 2-fold; the effect of PCA (10 microM) was strongly augmented by ouabain, whereas the effect of imipramine was not. The Na(+)/H(+) ionophore monensin (10 microM) also augmented the effect of PCA on efflux of [(3)H]5-HT as well as on efflux of [(3)H]MPP(+). In [(3)H]5-HT-labeled cells, the combination of imipramine and monensin raised [(3)H]5-HT efflux to a greater extent than either of the two substances alone. In [(3)H]MPP(+)-labeled cells, imipramine had no effect on its own and fully reversed the effect of monensin. The results suggest that the [(3)H]5-HT efflux caused by uptake inhibitors is entirely due to interrupted high-affinity reuptake, which is ongoing even under superfusion conditions.
10869589	Effects of inescapable stress and treatment with pyridostigmine bromide on plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the acoustic startle response in rats.	Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) is a reversible, peripherally active inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and is recommended by the military as a pretreatment against potential nerve gas exposure. Recent evidence suggests that exposure to inescapable stressors allows PB to cross the blood-brain barrier, and thereby affect central AChE activity in mice. Here, we evaluated the functional impact of a stress/PB treatment interaction on acoustic startle responding and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activity in male Sprague-Dawley rats. To model the treatment protocol used by the military, PB was delivered in the drinking water of rats for 7 consecutive days. The morning after the start of PB treatment, and for the next 6 days, half the rats were exposed to 1 h of supine restraint stress. We therefore employed a 2 x 2 (stress x PB treatment) between-groups design. Exposure to supine stress alone induced a persistent decrease in plasma BuChE activity. Further decreases in BuChE activity were not observed in rats exposed to supine restraint and PB treatment. Exposure to stress also induced an exaggerated startle response, evident on the last day of stress and 24 h after stressor cessation. Treatment with PB alone produced an exaggerated startle response over the same time period, albeit to a lesser degree. Although treatment with PB concurrent with stress did not produce further changes in either BuChE activity or acoustic startle responding, stress-induced alterations in drinking behavior (and thereby the dose of PB ingested) may have affected these results. Persistent stress-induced reductions in BuChE activity may increase the risk of adverse reactions to cholinomimetics.
10871202	Effects of troglitazone on blood concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes and in lean and obese normal subjects.	Low plasma fibrinolytic activity in association with increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels has been linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis in obesity and type 2 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that troglitazone, which improves insulin sensitivity and lowers plasma insulin levels in insulin-resistant obese subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes, would also lower circulating PAI-1 antigen concentrations and activity. We assessed insulin sensitivity (5-h, 80 mU x m(-2) x min(-1) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and measured plasma PAI-1 antigen and activities and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in 14 patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 normal control subjects (10 lean, 10 obese) before and after 3 months of treatment with troglitazone (600 mg/day). At baseline, plasma PAI-1 antigen levels after an overnight fast were significantly higher in the obese (33.5 +/- 4.7 microg/l) and type 2 diabetic subjects (54.9 +/- 6.3 microg/l) than in the lean control subjects (16.3 +/- 3.2 microg/l; P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Troglitazone decreased plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients (36.8 +/- 5.0 microg/l; P < 0.001 vs. baseline), but the reduction in the obese subjects did not reach statistical significance (baseline, 33.5 +/- 4.7; after troglitazone, 25.6 +/- 5.2 microg/l). Changes in plasma PAI-1 activity paralleled those of PAI-1 antigen. The extent of the reduction in plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients after troglitazone correlated with the reductions in fasting plasma insulin (r = 0.60, P < 0.05), nonesterified fatty acid (r = 0.63, P < 0.02), and glucose concentrations (r = 0.64, P < 0.02) but not with the improvement in glucose disposal rates during the glucose clamps. Three nonresponders to troglitazone with respect to effects on insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose and insulin levels also had no reduction in circulating PAI-1. In conclusion, troglitazone enhances fibrinolytic system activity in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic patients. This effect appears to be intimately linked to its potential to lower plasma insulin levels and improve glycemic control through its peripheral tissue insulin-sensitizing effects.
10873710	Maturation-dependent effects of chlorpyrifos and parathion and their oxygen analogs on acetylcholinesterase and neuronal and glial markers in aggregating brain cell cultures.	An in vitro model, the aggregating brain cell culture of fetal rat telencephalon, has been used to study the maturation-dependent sensitivity of brain cells to two organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), chlorpyrifos and parathion, and to their oxon derivatives. Immature (DIV 5-15) or differentiated (DIV 25-35) brain cells were treated continuously for 10 days. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory potency for the OPs was compared to that of eserine (physostigmine), a reversible AChE inhibitor. Oxon derivatives were more potent AChE inhibitors than the parent compounds, and parathion was more potent than chlorpyrifos. No maturation-dependent differences for AChE inhibition were found for chlorpyrifos and eserine, whereas for parathion and paraoxon there was a tendency to be more effective in immature cultures, while the opposite was true for chlorpyrifos-oxon. Toxic effects, assessed by measuring protein content as an index of general cytotoxicity, and various enzyme activities as cell-type-specific neuronal and glial markers (ChAT and GAD, for cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively, and GS and CNP, for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively) were only found at more than 70% of AChE inhibition. Immature compared to differentiated cholinergic neurons appeared to be more sensitive to OP treatments. The oxon derivates were found to be more toxic on neurons than the parent compounds, and chlorpyrifos was more toxic than parathion. Eserine was not neurotoxic. These results indicate that inhibition of AChE remains the most sensitive macromolecular target of OP exposure, since toxic effects were found at concentrations in which AChE was inhibited. Furthermore, the compound-specific reactions, the differential pattern of toxicity of OPs compared to eserine, and the higher sensitivity of immature brain cells suggest that the toxic effects and inhibition of AChE are unrelated.
10879826	Chromium (VI) accumulation reduces chlorophyll biosynthesis, nitrate reductase activity and protein content in Nymphaea alba L.	Plants of Nymphaea alba L. grown at various levels of chromium (VI) ranging from 1 to 200 microM accumulated chromium in concentration and duration-dependent manner. At all Cr levels, chromium accumulation by various plant tissues followed the order roots > leaves > rhizomes. Approximately 93% of total chromium present in the medium was accumulated by plants at lowest conentration (1 microM) used in the experiment. Chromium-induced toxicity appears at 1 microM chromium resulting in the build-up of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and reduced activities of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and nitrate reductase (NR), total chlorophyll (Chl) and protein contents. Ch1a was more sensitive than Ch1b to chromium toxicity. It could be inferred that chromium toxicity is not located at the level of ALA synthesis, but, probably at the ALAD activity which was more severely affected during chlorophyll biosynthesis. Finally, impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis resulted in reduced total chlorophyll content.
10898598	Phosphoacetylcholinesterase: toxicity of phosphorus oxychloride to mammals and insects that can be attributed to selective phosphorylation of acetylcholinesterase by phosphorodichloridic acid.	Phosphorus oxychloride (POCl(3)) is an intermediate in the synthesis of many organophosphorus insecticides and chemical warfare nerve gases that are toxic to insects and mammals by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. It was therefore surprising to observe that POCl(3), which is hydrolytically unstable, also itself gives poisoning signs in ip-treated mice and fumigant-exposed houseflies similar to those produced by the organophosphorus ester insecticides and chemical warfare agents. In mice, POCl(3) inhibits serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) at a sublethal dose and muscle but not brain AChE at a lethal dose. In houseflies, POCl(3)-induced brain AChE inhibition is correlated with poisoning and the probable cause thereof. POCl(3) in vitro is selective for AChE (IC(50) = 12-36 microM) compared with several other serine hydrolases (BuChE, carboxylesterase, elastase, alpha-chymotrypsin, and thrombin) (IC(50) = 88-2000 microM). With electric eel AChE, methylcarbamoylation of the active site with eserine reversibly protects against subsequent irreversible inhibition by POCl(3). Most importantly, POCl(3)-induced electric eel AChE inhibition prevents postlabeling with [(3)H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate; i.e., both compounds phosphorylate at Ser-200 in the catalytic triad. Pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide does not reactivate POCl(3)-inhibited AChE, consistent with an anionic phosphoserine residue at the esteratic site. The actual phosphorylating agent is formed within seconds from POCl(3) in water, has a half-life of approximately 2 min, and is identified as phosphorodichloridic acid [HOP(O)Cl(2)] by (31)P NMR and derivatization with dimethylamine to HOP(O)(NMe(2))(2). POCl(3) on reaction with water and HOP(O)Cl(2) have the same potency for inhibition of AChE from either electric eel or housefly head as well as the same toxicity for mice. In summary, the acute toxicity of POCl(3) is attributable to hydrolytic activation to HOP(O)Cl(2) that phosphorylates AChE at the active site to form enzymatically inactive [O-phosphoserine]AChE.
10917554	Vinblastine and sulfinpyrazone export by the multidrug resistance protein MRP2 is associated with glutathione export.	The multidrug resistance proteins MRP1 and MRP2 are members of the same subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Besides organic molecules conjugated to negatively charged ligands, these proteins also transport cytotoxic drugs for which no negatively charged conjugates are known to exist. In polarized MDCKII cells, MRP1 routes to the lateral plasma membrane, and MRP2 to the apical plasma membrane. In these cells MRP1 transports daunorubicin, and MRP2 vinblastine; both transporters export reduced glutathione (GSH) into the medium. We demonstrate that glutathione transport in MDCKII-MRP1 cells is inhibited by the inhibitors of organic anion transporters sulfinpyrazone, indomethacin, probenecid and benzbromarone. In MDCKII-MRP2 cells, GSH export is stimulated by low concentrations of sulfinpyrazone or indomethacin, whereas export is inhibited down to control levels at high concentrations. We find that unmodified sulfinpyrazone is a substrate for MRP2, also at concentrations where GSH export is inhibited. We also show that GSH export in MDCKII-MRP2 cells increases in the presence of vinblastine, and that the stoichiometry between drug and GSH exported is between two and three. Our data indicate that transport of sulfinpyrazone and vinblastine is associated with GSH export. However, at high sulfinpyrazone concentrations this compound is transported without GSH. Models of MRP action are discussed that could explain these results.
10921913	Amlexanox reversibly inhibits cell migration and proliferation and induces the Src-dependent disassembly of actin stress fibers in vitro.	Amlexanox binds S100A13 and inhibits the release of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Because members of the S100 gene family are known to be involved with the function of the cytoskeleton, we examined the ability of amlexanox to modify the cytoskeleton and report that amlexanox induces a dramatic reduction in the presence of actin stress fibers and the appearance of a random, non-oriented distribution of focal adhesion sites. Correspondingly, amlexanox induces the complete and reversible non-apoptotic inhibition of cell migration and proliferation, and although amlexanox does not induce either the down-regulation of F-actin levels or the depolymerization of actin filaments, it does induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, a Src substrate known to regulate actin bundling. In addition, a dominant negative form of Src is able to partially rescue cells from the effect of amlexanox on both the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. In contrast, the inhibition of cell proliferation by amlexanox correlates with the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression without interference of the receptor tyrosine kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Last, the ability of amlexanox to inhibit FGF1 release is reversible and correlates with the restoration of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role for the actin cytoskeleton in the FGF1 release pathway.
10922459	A 45 kDa protein related to PPARgamma2, induced by peroxisome proliferators, is located in the mitochondrial matrix.	Besides their involvement in the control of nuclear gene expression by activating several peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), peroxisome proliferators influence mitochondrial activity. By analogy with the previous characterization of a mitochondrial T3 receptor (p43), we searched for the presence of a peroxisome proliferator target in the organelle. Using several antisera raised against different domains of PPARs, we demonstrated by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and electron microscopy experiments, that a 45 kDa protein related to PPARgamma2 (mt-PPAR) is located in the matrix of rat liver mitochondria. In addition, we found that the amounts of mt-PPAR are increased by clofibrate treatment. Moreover, in EMSA experiments mt-PPAR bound to a DR2 sequence located in the mitochondrial D-loop, by forming a complex with p43. Last, studies of tissue-specific expression indicated that mt-PPAR is detected in mitochondria of all tissues tested except the brain in amounts positively related to p43 abundance.

10950107	Gastric mucosal cell proliferation in ethanol-induced chronic mucosal injury is related to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in rats.	The oxygen free radicals-induced lipid peroxidation (LP) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions. However, the role of LP in the generation of chronic gastric mucosal injury is unknown. We have developed a model of chronic mucosal injury induced by continuous ethanol ingestion for 5 days and characterized by marked alterations in plasma membranes from gastric mucosa. Therefore, LP was evaluated in this experimental model. Indicators of peroxidative activity, mucosal glutathione content, thymidine kinase activity (an index of cell proliferation), and histamine H2-receptor (H2R) binding constants were quantified in animals undergoing gastric mucosal damage. The effect of famotidine, a H2R antagonist that readily ameliorates the chronic mucosal injury, was also tested. Increased free radicals and LP levels were detected during gastritis; however, a second, higher peak of LP was noted in mucosal plasma membranes after ethanol withdrawal (recovery period). This further increase of LP coincided with active cell proliferation, decreased mucosal glutathione levels, and diminished specific cimetidine binding by H2R. Administration of famotidine accelerated the mucosal proliferative process, inducing the second lipoperoxidative episode sooner, and preserved the content of glutathione. In addition, LP correlated directly with cell proliferation and inversely with mucosal membrane cimetidine binding. In conclusion, LP seems to be involved in chronic ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury. However, a further enhancement of plasma membrane LP occurred, associated with increased DNA synthesis and diminished cimetidine binding by membrane H2R. Therefore, increased LP could also participate in the compensatory mucosal proliferation initiated after ethanol withdrawal.
10951268	Stimulation of PPARalpha promotes epidermal keratinocyte differentiation in vivo.	Our recent studies have demonstrated that PPARalpha activators stimulate differentiation and inhibit proliferation in cultured human keratinocytes and accelerate epidermal development and permeability barrier formation in fetal rat skin explants. As the role of PPARalpha activation in adult epidermis is not known, the aim of this study was to determine if topically applied PPARalpha ligands regulate keratinocyte differentiation in murine epidermis. Topical treatment with PPARalpha activators resulted in decreased epidermal thickness. Expression of structural proteins of the upper spinous/granular layers (involucrin, profilaggrin-filaggrin, loricrin) increased following topical treatment with PPARalpha activators. Furthermore, topically applied PPARalpha activators also increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and accelerated recovery of barrier function following acute barrier abrogation. Experiments with PPARalpha-/- knockout mice showed that these effects are specifically mediated via PPARalpha. Compared with the epidermis of PPARalpha+/+ mice, involucrin, profilaggrin-filaggrin, and loricrin expression were slightly decreased in PPARalpha-/- mice. Moreover, topical clofibrate treatment did not increase epidermal differentiation in PPARalpha-/- mice. Furthermore, in cultured human keratinocytes we have demonstrated that PPARalpha activators induce an increase in involucrin mRNA levels. We have also shown that this increase in gene expression requires an intact AP-1 response element at -2117 to -2111 bp. Thus, stimulation of PPARalpha stimulates keratinocyte/epidermal differentiation and inhibits proliferation.
10952689	Inhibition of HERG potassium channels by the antimalarial agent halofantrine.	Halofantrine is a widely used antimalarial agent which has been associated with prolongation of the 'QT interval' of the electrocardiogram (ECG), torsades de pointes and sudden death. Whilst QT prolongation is consistent with halofantrine-induced increases in cardiac ventricular action potential duration, the cellular mechanism for these observations has not been previously reported. The delayed rectifier potassium channel, I(Kr), is a primary site of action of drugs causing QT prolongation and is encoded by the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). We examined the effects of halofantrine on HERG potassium channels stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Halofantrine blocked HERG tail currents elicited on repolarization to -60 mV from +30 mV with an IC(50) of 196.9 nM. The therapeutic plasma concentration range for halofantrine is 1.67-2.98 microM. Channel inhibition by halofantrine exhibited time-, voltage- and use-dependence. Halofantrine did not alter the time course of channel activation or deactivation, but inactivation was accelerated and there was a 20 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the mid-activation potential of steady-state inactivation. Block was enhanced by pulses that render channels inactivated, and channel blockade increased with increasing duration of depolarizing pulses. We conclude that HERG channel inhibition by halofantrine is the likely underlying cellular mechanism for QT prolongation. Our data suggest preferential binding of halofantrine to the open and inactivated channel states.
10961955	The elusive link between LQT3 and Brugada syndrome: the role of flecainide challenge.	Defects of the SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel are associated with both the LQT3 subtype of long-QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome (BS). The typical manifestations of long-QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation) and BS (ST segment elevation in leads V1 through V3) may coexist in the same patients, which raises questions about the actual differences between LQT3 and BS. Intravenous flecainide is the standard provocative test used to unmask BS in individuals with concealed forms of the disease, and oral flecainide has been proposed as a treatment option for LQT3 patients because it may shorten their QT interval.
10968199	Comparison of the antihypertensive effects of the new angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in rats.	Antihypertensive effects of an angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil (TCV-116), were compared with those of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 2-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive rats (2K, 1C-HR) and 1-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive rats (1K, 1C-HR). CV-11974, the active form of TCV-116, had no inhibitory activity for plasma ACE. In rats, TCV-116 inhibited the pressor responses to Ang I, Ang II, and Ang III without an effect on the bradykinin (BK)-induced depressor response. Enalapril inhibited only the Ang I-response and potentiated the BK-response. In SHR, the antihypertensive effect of TCV-116 (10 mg/kg) was larger than the maximum antihypertensive effect of enalapril and was not intensified by combination with enalapril. Administration of CV-11974 potentiated the maximum antihypertensive effect of enalapril. Although both agents reduced blood pressure in 2K, 1C-HR, only TCV-116 had a marked antihypertensive effect in 1K, 1C-HR. These findings indicate that TCV-116 is more effective than enalapril in reducing blood pressure in SHR and 1K, 1C-HR, and that the BK- and/or prostaglandin-potentiating effect of enalapril contributes little to its antihypertensive mechanism in SHR.
10977131	Constitutive cyclooxygenase-1 and induced cyclooxygenase-2 in isolated human iris inhibited by S(+) flurbiprofen.	The purpose of the present study was to characterize the isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) in the human iris before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to determine the selectivity of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), S(+) flurbiprofen, for inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 in homogenates of this tissue. Spotblots were made of extracts of human iris in the absence and presence of LPS plus acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). After reacting with anti-COX-1 and anti-COX-2 immunoglobulin G, the presence of both immunoreactive COX enzymes was substantiated using an indirect immunoperoxidase method. Authentic COX-1 and COX-2 were used as controls. Using an enzyme immune assay (EIA), the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was quantified in tissue homogenates of human iris under the same conditions as described above. S(+) flurbiprofen was added to tissue homogenates in order to determine the inhibitory effect on PGE2 production. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of S(+) flurbiprofen for the PGE2 production in the tissue homogenates were determined from concentration inhibition curves. The selectivity of S(+) flurbiprofen for inhibition of COX-1 was expressed as the ratio of IC50 for COX-2/COX-1. Spotblots of nonstimulated iris-extracts showed positive staining for COX-1 immunoreactivity (-ir) only. After incubation with LPS plus acetylsalicylic acid, positive staining was observed for both COX-1-ir and COX-2-ir. Concentrations of PGE2 released from homogenates of untreated iris varied from 1.5-4 ng/ml, and of LPS-stimulated tissue from 10-20 ng/ml of assay mixture. S(+) flurbiprofen inhibited PGE2 production of untreated tissue homogenates at an IC50 of 8 x 10(-10) M whereas, in the stimulated tissue, IC50 was found to be 3 x 10(-6) M. The selectivity of S(+) flurbiprofen for inhibition of constitutively present COX-1, relative to the inhibition of induced COX-2, was 3,600. Our results indicate that specific expression of COX isoforms in normal human iris was substantiated at the protein level by immunoreaction on spotblots. COX-1 represents the constitutively present enzyme, and COX-2 appears after stimulation with LPS. At the functional level, S(+) flurbiprofen possesses a specificity for COX-1 in inhibiting PGE2 production.
10991846	Upregulation of ERG genes in Candida species by azoles and other sterol biosynthesis inhibitors.	Infections due to Candida albicans are usually treated with azole antifungals such as fluconazole, but treatment failure is not uncommon especially in immunocompromised individuals. Relatedly, in vitro studies demonstrate that azoles are nonfungicidal, with continued growth at strain-dependent rates even at high azole concentrations. We hypothesized that upregulation of ERG11, which encodes the azole target enzyme lanosterol demethylase, contributes to this azole tolerance in Candida species. RNA analysis revealed that ERG11 expression in C. albicans is maximal during logarithmic-phase growth and decreases as the cells approach stationary phase. Incubation with fluconazole, however, resulted in a two- to fivefold increase in ERG11 RNA levels within 2 to 3 h, and this increase was followed by resumption of culture growth. ERG11 upregulation also occurred following treatment with other azoles (itraconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole) and was not dependent on the specific medium or pH. Within 1 h of drug removal ERG11 upregulation was reversed. Azole-dependent upregulation was not limited to ERG11: five of five ERG genes tested whose products function upstream and downstream of lanosterol demethylase in the sterol biosynthetic pathway were also upregulated. Similarly, ERG11 upregulation occurred following treatment of C. albicans cultures with terbinafine and fenpropimorph, which target other enzymes in the pathway. These data suggest a common mechanism for global ERG upregulation, e.g., in response to ergosterol depletion. Finally, azole-dependent ERG11 upregulation was demonstrated in three additional Candida species (C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei), indicating a conserved response to sterol biosynthesis inhibitors in opportunistic yeasts.
10995826	Ictal epileptiform activity is facilitated by hippocampal GABAA receptor-mediated oscillations.	The cellular and network mechanisms of the transition of brief interictal discharges to prolonged seizures are a crucial issue in epilepsy. Here we used hippocampal slices exposed to ACSF containing 0 Mg(2+) to explore mechanisms for the transition to prolonged (3-42 sec) seizure-like ("ictal") discharges. Epileptiform activity, evoked by Shaffer collateral stimulation, triggered prolonged bursts in CA1, in 50-60% of slices, from both adult and young (postnatal day 13-21) rats. In these cases the first component of the CA1 epileptiform burst was followed by a train of population spikes at frequencies in the gamma band and above (30-120 Hz, reminiscent of tetanically evoked gamma oscillations). The gamma burst in turn could be followed by slower repetitive "tertiary" bursts. Intracellular recordings from CA1 during the gamma phase revealed long depolarizations, action potentials rising from brief apparent hyperpolarizations, and a drop of input resistance. The CA1 gamma rhythm was completely blocked by bicuculline (10-50 microm), by ethoxyzolamide (100 microm), and strongly attenuated in hyperosmolar perfusate (50 mm sucrose). Subsequent tertiary bursts were also blocked by bicuculline, ethoxyzolamide, and in hyperosmolar perfusate. In all these cases intracellular recordings from CA3 revealed only short depolarizations. We conclude that under epileptogenic conditions, gamma band oscillations arise from GABA(A)ergic depolarizations and that this activity may lead to the generation of ictal discharges.
10997731	The interaction of antidepressant drugs with enteric 5-HT7 receptors.	In this study the functional interaction of the antidepressant drugs amitriptyline, mianserin, maprotiline, imipramine, fluoxetine and the putative antidepressant drug flibanserin has been studied on 5-HT7-mediated responses to 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) in the guinea-pig ileum. 5-CT induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the contractile response to substance P (100 nM). Except for fluoxetine and flibanserin, all the antidepressants antagonized by different degrees the 5-CT inhibitory response with the following rank affinity order: mianserin > maprotiline > imipramine > amitriptyline. Mianserin was the only antidepressant to show a profile of competitive antagonism at 5-HT7 receptors in a tenfold range of concentrations (0.1-1 microM), with an affinity (pA2) value of 8.1 +/- 0.6. The antagonism of the other antidepressants was not concentration-dependent (amitriptyline) or was associated with slight or moderate reduction of the maximal 5-CT response (imipramine or maprotiline). The apparent affinity (pKB) values were: amitriptyline, 7.0 +/- 0.2; maprotiline, 7.3 +/- 0.6; imipramine, 7.2 +/- 0.4. Our results show that various antidepressant drugs belonging to different chemical classes behave as antagonists at enteric 5-HT7 receptors through competitive or allosteric mechanisms. This evidence extends our previous findings demonstrating the interaction of antidepressants with other 5-HT receptors, namely 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors.
10998224	Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase of isolates from the Amazon region of Brazil.	Since the late 1970s pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (PS; FansidarTM Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel) has been used as first line therapy for uncomplicated malaria in the Amazon basin. Unfortunately, resistance has developed over the last ten years in many regions of the Amazon and PS is no longer recommended for use in Brazil. In vitro resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil (the active metabolite of proguanil) is caused by specific point mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and in vitro resistance to sulfadoxine has been associated with mutations in dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). In association with a proguanil-sulfamethoxazole clinical trial in Brazil, we performed a nested mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction to measure the prevalence of DHFR mutations at codons 50, 51, 59, 108 and 164 and DHPS mutations at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 at three sites in the Brazilian Amazon. Samples from two isolated towns showed a high degree of homogeneity, with the DHFR Arg-50/Ile-51/Asn-108 and DHPS Gly-437/Glu-540/Gly-581 mutant genotype accounting for all infections in Peixoto de Azevedo (n = 15) and 60% of infections in Apiacás (n = 10), State of Mato Grosso. The remaining infections in Apiacás differed from this predominant genotype only by the addition of the Bolivia repeat at codon 30 and the Leu-164 mutation in DHFR. By contrast, 17 samples from Porto Velho, capital city of the State of Rondônia, with much in- and out-migration, showed a wide variety of DHFR and DHPS genotypes.
11006272	A novel hepatointestinal leukotriene B4 receptor. Cloning and functional characterization.	Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a product of eicosanoid metabolism and acts as an extremely potent chemotactic mediator for inflammation. LTB(4) exerts positive effects on the immigration and activation of leukocytes. These effects suggest an involvement of LTB(4) in several diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and asthma. LTB(4) elicits actions through interaction with one or more cell surface receptors that lead to chemotaxis and inflammation. One leukotriene B(4) receptor has been recently identified (LTB(4)-R1). In this report we describe cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel 358-amino acid receptor (LTB(4)-R2) that possesses seven membrane-spanning domains and is homologous (42%) and genetically linked to LTB(4)-R1. Expression of LTB(4)-R2 is broad but highest in liver, intestine, spleen, and kidney. In radioligand binding assays, membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with LTB(4)-R2 cDNA displayed high affinity (K(d) = 0.17 nm) for [(3)H]LTB(4). Radioligand competition assays revealed high affinities of the receptor for LTB(4) and LTB(5), and 20-hydroxy-LTB(4), and intermediate affinities for 15(S)-HETE and 12-oxo-ETE. Three LTB(4) receptor antagonists, 14,15-dehydro-LTB(4), LTB(4)-3-aminopropylamide, and U-75302, had high affinity for LTB(4)-R1 but not for LTB(4)-R2. No apparent affinity binding for the receptors was detected for the CysLT1-selective antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast. LTB(4) functionally mobilized intracellular calcium and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in 293 cells. The discovery of this new receptor should aid in further understanding the roles of LTB(4) in pathologies in these tissues and may provide a tool in identification of specific antagonists/agonists for potential therapeutic treatments.
11009046	A comparison of the effects of etodolac and ibuprofen on renal haemodynamics, tubular function, renin, vasopressin and urinary excretion of albumin and alpha-glutathione-S-transferase in healthy subjects: a placebo-controlled cross-over study.	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to be potentially nephrotoxic agents. NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase and thereby block the prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys. Cyclo-oxygenase exists in two isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2). It has been proposed that NSAIDs with preferential COX-2 selectivity have fewer renal side effects than drugs with preferential COX-1 selectivity. Etodolac is a relative selective inhibitor of COX-2, while ibuprofen has a higher potency against COX-1 than COX-2.
11018525	New molecular aspects of regulation of mitochondrial activity by fenofibrate and fasting.	Fenofibrate and fasting are known to regulate several genes involved in lipid metabolism in a similar way. In this study measuring several mitochondrial enzyme activities, we demonstrate that, in contrast to citrate synthase and complex II, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a specific target of these two treatments. In mouse liver organelles, Western blot experiments indicated that mitochondrial levels of p43, a mitochondrial T3 receptor, and mitochondrial peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (mt-PPAR), previously described as a dimeric partner of p43 in the organelle, are increased by both fenofibrate and fasting. In addition, in PPAR alpha-deficient mice, this influence was abolished for mt-PPAR but not for p43, whereas the increase in COX activity was not altered. These data indicate that: (1) PPAR alpha is involved in specific regulation of mt-PPAR expression by both treatments; (2) fenofibrate and fasting regulate the mitochondrial levels of p43 and thus affect the efficiency of the direct T3 mitochondrial pathway.
11027924	Allelic variation in the serotonin transporter promoter affects onset of paroxetine treatment response in late-life depression.	The relationship of the serotonin transporter gene promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) to antidepressant response was examined in 95 elderly patients receiving a protocolized treatment for depression with paroxetine or nortriptyline. Patients were treated for up to 12 weeks and assessed weekly with clinical ratings and measurements of plasma drug concentrations. Twenty-one of the paroxetine-treated subjects were found to have the ll genotype and 30 had at least one s allele. There were no baseline differences between these groups in pretreatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores or anxiety symptoms. During acute treatment with paroxetine, mean reductions from baseline in HRSD were significantly more rapid for patients with the ll genotype than for those possessing an s allele, despite equivalent paroxetine concentrations. Onset of response to nortriptyline was not affected. Allelic variation of 5-HTTLPR may contribute to the variable initial response of patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
11041225	The effect of progestins on vascular endothelial growth factor, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor immunoreactivity and endothelial cell density in human endometrium.	One common side-effect of contraceptive use is that it often leads to disrupted endometrial bleeding patterns. This may be due to changes in endothelial density and vessel integrity. To investigate whether the level of endometrial immunoreactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), oestrogen receptor or progesterone receptor (PR) have any role in this, women were treated with either Mircette, a monophasic oral contraceptive, or Implanon, a long-acting gestagen, and immunohistochemistry performed. In addition a small number of endometria were studied from women treated with levonorgestrel released from an intrauterine coil. During the untreated normal cycle, there was a significant increase in glandular VEGF immunoreactivity and a significant decrease in PR immunoreactivity in the midand late secretory phases compared to the proliferative phase. There was a significant positive correlation between stromal VEGF immunoreactivity and endothelial cell density. This correlation was also apparent during treatment with Implanon, but not with Mircette. Disrupted bleeding patterns were associated with Implanon and to a lesser extent with Mircette. Both contraceptives significantly reduced glandular VEGF immunoreactivity but the intrauterine treatment with levonorgestrel resulted in strong glandular epithelial staining and intense staining of decidualized stromal cells. Implanon significantly increased glandular PR staining, but Mircette significantly reduced stromal PR staining when compared to secretory phase before-treatment biopsies. There were no changes in endothelial cell density or glandular or stromal ER during the normal cycle, or with use of either contraceptive. There was no association of the parameters measured with bleeding patterns or histological category.
11046101	Tasosartan, enoltasosartan, and angiotensin II receptor blockade: the confounding role of protein binding.	Tasosartan is a long-acting angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker. Its long duration of action has been attributed to its active metabolite enoltasosartan. In this study we evaluated the relative contribution of tasosartan and enoltasosartan to the overall pharmacological effect of tasosartan. AngII receptor blockade effect of single doses of tasosartan (100 mg p.o. and 50 mg i.v) and enoltasosartan (2.5 mg i.v.) were compared in 12 healthy subjects in a randomized, double blind, three-period crossover study using two approaches: the in vivo blood pressure response to exogenous AngII and an ex vivo AngII radioreceptor assay. Tasosartan induced a rapid and sustained blockade of AngII subtype-1 (AT1) receptors. In vivo, tasosartan (p.o. or i.v.) blocked by 80% AT1 receptors 1 to 2 h after drug administration and still had a 40% effect at 32 h. In vitro, the blockade was estimated to be 90% at 2 h and 20% at 32 h. In contrast, the blockade induced by enoltasosartan was markedly delayed and hardly reached 60 to 70% despite the i.v. administration and high plasma levels. In vitro, the AT1 antagonistic effect of enoltasosartan was markedly influenced by the presence of plasma proteins, leading to a decrease in its affinity for the receptor and a slower receptor association rate. The early effect of tasosartan is due mainly to tasosartan itself with little if any contribution of enoltasosartan. The antagonistic effect of enoltasosartan appears later. The delayed in vivo blockade effect observed for enoltasosartan appears to be due to a high and tight protein binding and a slow dissociation process from the carrier.
11050088	Inhibition of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases by thiolactomycin and cerulenin. Structure and mechanism.	The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases are key regulators of type II fatty acid synthesis and are the targets for two natural products, thiolactomycin (TLM) and cerulenin. The high resolution structures of the FabB-TLM and FabB-cerulenin binary complexes were determined. TLM mimics malonyl-ACP in the FabB active site. It forms strong hydrogen bond interactions with the two catalytic histidines, and the unsaturated alkyl side chain interaction with a small hydrophobic pocket is stabilized by pi stacking interactions. Cerulenin binding mimics the condensation transition state. The subtle differences between the FabB-cerulenin and FabF-cerulenin (Moche, M., Schneider, G., Edwards, P., Dehesh, K., and Lindqvist, Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 6031-6034) structures explain the differences in the sensitivity of the two enzymes to the antibiotic and may reflect the distinct substrate specificities that differentiate the two enzymes. The FabB[H333N] protein was prepared to convert the FabB His-His-Cys active site triad into the FabH His-Asn-Cys configuration to test the importance of the two His residues in TLM and cerulenin binding. FabB[H333N] was significantly more resistant to both antibiotics than FabB and had an affinity for TLM an order of magnitude less than the wild-type enzyme, illustrating that the two-histidine active site architecture is critical to protein-antibiotic interaction. These data provide a structural framework for understanding antibiotic sensitivity within this group of enzymes.
11061213	An autoradiographic method of visualising semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity in mouse tissue sections.	Under the influence of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), methylamine is deaminated to formaldehyde, which can react with various macromolecules and form irreversible adducts. We hereby present an autoradiographic method of visualising SSAO activity by measuring the in vivo formation of such adducts from 14C-methylamine. Our results revealed high concentrations of radioactive deposits in the intestinal wall, brown adipose tissue, spleen and bone marrow. Hydralazine is a potent SSAO inhibitor and pretreatment with this irreversible inactivator resulted in a nearly complete loss of radioactive deposits in the tissues. By giving 14C-methylamine at different time-points after irreversible inhibition of SSAO, it was also possible to determine the resynthesis rate of SSAO. Interestingly, the recovery rate of SSAO after such inactivation was tissue-specific. The possible therapeutic value of a specific SSAO inhibitory drug has been discussed.
11069595	Effects of eletriptan on the peptidergic innervation of the cerebral dura mater and trigeminal ganglion, and on the expression of c-fos and c-jun in the trigeminal complex of the rat in an experimental migraine model.	Nociceptive axons and terminals in the supratentorial cerebral dura mater display an intense calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity. In an experimental migraine model, it has been shown that electrical stimulation of the rat trigeminal ganglion induced an increase in the lengths of CGRP-immunoreactive axons, increased size and number of pleomorphic axonal varicosities in the dura mater, and an increased number of c-jun and c-fos protein-expressing nerve cells in the trigeminal complex. We demonstrate the effect of the highly specific and moderately lipophilic serotonin agonist eletriptan (Pfizer) which prevents the effects of electrical stimulation in the dura mater. Eletriptan also affected the caudal trigeminal complex; it markedly reduced the numbers of the oncoprotein-expressing cells, mainly after stimulation and to some extent also in nonstimulated animals. Eletriptan also affected expression of CGRP in perikarya of trigeminal ganglion cells, insofar as the number of small nerve cells exhibiting a compact CGRP immunoreaction was decreased to one quarter of the original value. In all these respects, eletriptan acted in a similar way to sumatriptan, with the notable exception that eletriptan also blocked the stimulation-induced effects in the nucleus caudalis trigemini and the upper cervical spinal cord (trigeminal complex), whereas sumatriptan did not. It is concluded that eletriptan, acting on perikarya and both the peripheral and the central axon terminals of primary sensory neurons, exerts its antimigraine effect by an agonist action on 5-HT1B/1D receptors throughout the entire trigeminal system, probably by passing the blood-brain-barrier because of its lipophilic character.
11073937	Genetic analysis of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in mycobacteria: characterization of a ddlA mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis.	A temperature-sensitive mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis was characterized that contains a mutation in ddlA, the gene encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. Enzymatic assays using recombinant proteins and D-cycloserine susceptibility indicate that the A365V mutation in the SMEG35 DdlA protein causes a reduction in enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo.
11078030	The new cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease, Part 1: their similarities are different.	Three new cholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, all inhibit the enzyme AChE. Rivastigmine also inhibits BuChE, which could lead to additional benefits in late-stage Alzheimer's disease, but also cause more GI side effects at initiation of therapy. Galantamine is also an allosteric modulator of nicotinic receptors, which could lead to additional efficacy for attention and for behaviors mediated by neurotransmitters other than ACh. We are now entering an exciting era where the options for treating the devastating illness Alzheimer's disease are multiplying and creating a foundation upon which new therapies with new mechanisms of action can be built.
11090546	Probing the interaction between inactivation gating and Dd-sotalol block of HERG.	Potassium channels encoded by HERG underlie I:(Kr), a sensitive target for most class III antiarrhythmic drugs, including methanesulfonanilides such as Dd-sotalol. Recently it was shown that these drugs are trapped in the channel as it closes during hyperpolarization. At the same time, HERG channels rapidly open and inactivate when depolarized, and methanesulfonanilide block is known to develop in a use-dependent manner, suggesting a potential role for inactivation in drug binding. However, the role of HERG inactivation in class III drug action is uncertain: pore mutations that remove inactivation reduce block, yet many of these mutations also modify the channel permeation properties and could alter drug affinity through gating-independent mechanisms. In the present study, we identify a definitive role for inactivation gating in Dd-sotalol block of HERG, using interventions complementary to mutagenesis. These interventions (addition of extracellular Cd(2+), removal of extracellular Na(+)) modify the voltage dependence of inactivation but not activation. In normal extracellular solutions, block of HERG current by 300 micromol/L Dd-sotalol reached 80% after a 10-minute period of repetitive depolarization to +20 mV. Maneuvers that impeded steady-state inactivation also reduced Dd-sotalol block of HERG: 100 micromol/L Cd(2+) reduced steady-state block to 55% at +20 mV (P:<0.05); removing extracellular Na(+) reduced block to 44% (P:<0.05). An inactivation-disabling mutation (G628C-S631C) reduced Dd-sotalol block to only 11% (P:<0.05 versus wild type). However, increasing the rate of channel inactivation by depolarizing to +60 mV reduced Dd-sotalol block to 49% (P:<0.05 versus +20 mV), suggesting that the drug does not primarily bind to the inactivated state. Coexpression of MiRP1 with HERG had no effect on inactivation gating and did not modify Dd-sotalol block. We postulate that Dd-sotalol accesses its receptor in the open pore, and the drug-receptor interaction is then stabilized by inactivation. Whereas deactivation traps the bound methanesulfonanilide during hyperpolarization, we propose that HERG inactivation stabilizes the drug-receptor interaction during membrane depolarization.
11102491	NMDA and glutamate evoke excitotoxicity at distinct cellular locations in rat cortical neurons in vitro.	The development of cortical neurons in vivo and in vitro is accompanied by alterations in NMDA receptor subunit expression and concomitant modifications in the pharmacological profile of NMDA-activated ionic currents. For example, we observed that with decreasing NR2B/NR2A subunit expression ratio, the block of NMDA receptor-mediated whole-cell responses by the NR2B-selective antagonist haloperidol was also decreased. In mature cultures (>22 d in vitro), however, NMDA responses obtained from excised nucleated macropatches, which comprised a large portion of the soma, remained strongly antagonized by haloperidol. These results suggest that in more mature neurons NR1/NR2B receptors appear to be preferentially expressed in the cell body. As predicted from the whole-cell recording pharmacological profile, NMDA-induced toxicity was largely unaffected by haloperidol in mature cultures. However, haloperidol effectively blocked glutamate toxicity in the same cultures, suggesting that the neurotoxic actions of this amino acid were mostly due to the activation of somatic NMDA receptors. In experiments in which the potency of glutamate toxicity was increased by the transport inhibitor l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, the neuroprotective effects of haloperidol were significantly diminished. This was likely because of the fact that glutamate, now toxic at much lower concentrations, was able to reach and activate dendritic receptors under these conditions. These results strongly argue that exogenous glutamate and NMDA normally induce excitotoxicity at distinct cellular locations in mature mixed neuronal cultures and that NR1/NR2B receptors remain an important component in the expression of glutamate, but not NMDA-induced excitotoxicity.
11103883	In-vivo assessment of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C antagonistic properties of newer antipsychotics.	The effects of serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligands on the MK 212 (6-chloro-2[1-piperazinyl]pyrazine) discriminative stimulus and quipazine-induced head twitches were studied in rats. 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT) and preferential 5-HT2A (DOI) receptor agonists did not generalize to the discriminative stimulus. The 5-HT2B/2C-receptor antagonist, SB 206553 (5-methyl-1-(3-pyridylcarbamoyl)-1,2,3,5-tetrahydropyrrolo[2 ,3-f]indole), and the 5-HT2A/2C-receptor antagonist, ritanserin, acted as potent antagonists, whereas the 5-HT2A-receptor antagonist, MDL 100.151 ([(+/-)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4- piperidine-methanol), produced minor and inconsistent inhibition. SB 206553 was a weak antagonist against quipazine-induced head twitches, whereas MDL 100.151 and ritanserin were potent antagonists. This suggests that the MK 212 discriminative stimulus is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors, while quipazine-induced head twitches are mediated primarily by 5-HT2A receptors. The effects on quipazine-induced head twitches were comparable to previously published effects on the DOI discriminative stimulus. 5-HT2A- and 5-HT2C-receptor antagonistic potencies of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole and ziprasidone were compared in the same models. Clozapine showed similar potencies in both models, while sertindole, olanzapine and risperidone inhibited quipazine-induced effects more potently than the MK 212 discriminative stimulus. Ziprasidone exerted a minor preference for 5-HT2A- compared to 5-HT2C-receptor-mediated effects. The ratio between in vivo inhibitory potencies at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors did not correlate with corresponding ratios from in-vitro affinity and ex-vivo occupancy studies in the literature.
11108662	Role of multidrug-resistance protein 2 in glutathione S-transferase P1-1-mediated resistance to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide toxicities in HepG2 cells.	Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the phase III efflux transporter multidrug-resistance protein (MRP)1 can act synergistically with the phase II conjugating glutathione S-transferases (GST) to confer resistance to the toxicities of some electrophilic drugs and carcinogens. To determine whether the distinct efflux transporter MRP2 could also potentiate GST-mediated protection from electrophilic toxins, we examined the effect of regulatable GSTP1-1 expression in MRP2-rich HepG2 cells on 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO)-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (nucleic-acid adduct formation). Expression of GSTP1-1 was associated with a fourfold to tenfold protection from 4NQO-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibition of MRP2-mediated efflux activity by sulfinpyrazone or cyclosporin A completely reversed GSTP1-1-associated resistance-a result indicating that GSTP1-1-mediated cytoprotection is absolutely dependent on MRP2 efflux activity. Moreover, MRP2 efflux activity also augmented GSTP1-1-mediated protection from 4NQO-induced nucleic-acid adduct formation. We conclude that MRP2-mediated efflux of the glutathione conjugate of 4NQO and/or another toxic derivative of 4NQO is required to support GSTP1-1-associated protection from 4NQO toxicities in HepG2 cells.
11118042	Sulindac sulfone inhibits K-ras-dependent cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human colon cancer cells.	Both the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, display anticarcinogenic effects in experimental models. Sulindac sulfide inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activities and has been reported to suppress ras-dependent signaling. However, the mechanisms by which sulindac sulfone suppresses cancer growth are not as defined. We studied the effects of these sulindac metabolites in human colon cancer-derived Caco-2 cells that have been transfected with an activated K-ras oncogene. Stable transfected clones expressed high levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein, compared with parental cells. K-ras-transfected cells formed tumors more quickly when injected into severe combined immunodeficiency disease mice than parental cells, and this tumorigenesis was suppressed by treatment with sulindac. Sulindac sulfone inhibited COX-2 protein expression, which resulted in a decrease in prostaglandin synthase E2 production. Sulindac sulfide had little effect on COX-2 in this model, but did suppress prostaglandin synthase E2 production, presumably by inhibiting COX enzyme activity. These data indicate that the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of sulindac exert COX-dependent effects by distinct mechanisms.
11120594	Cytokine production by naive and primary effector CD4+ T cells exposed to norepinephrine.	We recently showed that clones of Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, expressed a functional beta-2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and that either norepinephrine or the beta2AR agonist terbutaline stimulated this receptor to modulate the level of Th1 cytokines produced. In the present study, we show that norepinephrine and terbutaline stimulate the beta2AR to decrease the level of IL-2 produced by freshly isolated murine splenic naive CD4+ T cells from either Balb/C or DO11.10 transgenic mice and activated polyclonally with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. In contrast, the level of cytokines produced by primary effector Th1 and Th2 cells were unaffected when norepinephrine, terbutaline, or cAMP analogs were added at the time of restimulation. These results suggest that a diversity exists among CD4+ T-cell subsets with respect to the level of adrenergic receptor expression, responsiveness to cAMP, stage of cell differentiation, or a combination of the above.
11121413	Mutational and X-ray crystallographic analysis of the interaction of dihomo-gamma -linolenic acid with prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases.	Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2 (PGHSs) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Both isozymes can oxygenate a variety of related polyunsaturated fatty acids. We report here the x-ray crystal structure of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA) in the cyclooxygenase site of PGHS-1 and the effects of active site substitutions on the oxygenation of DHLA, and we compare these results to those obtained previously with arachidonic acid (AA). DHLA is bound within the cyclooxygenase site in the same overall L-shaped conformation as AA. C-1 and C-11 through C-20 are in the same positions for both substrates, but the positions of C-2 through C-10 differ by up to 1.74 A. In general, substitutions of active site residues caused parallel changes in the oxygenation of both AA and DHLA. Two significant exceptions were Val-349 and Ser-530. A V349A substitution caused an 800-fold decrease in the V(max)/K(m) for DHLA but less than a 2-fold change with AA; kinetic evidence indicates that C-13 of DHLA is improperly positioned with respect to Tyr-385 in the V349A mutant thereby preventing efficient hydrogen abstraction. Val-349 contacts C-5 of DHLA and appears to serve as a structural bumper positioning the carboxyl half of DHLA, which, in turn, positions properly the omega-half of this substrate. A V349A substitution in PGHS-2 has similar, minor effects on the rates of oxygenation of AA and DHLA. Thus, Val-349 is a major determinant of substrate specificity for PGHS-1 but not for PGHS-2. Ser-530 also influences the substrate specificity of PGHS-1; an S530T substitution causes 40- and 750-fold decreases in oxygenation efficiencies for AA and DHLA, respectively.
11132243	Binding of antipsychotic drugs to human brain receptors focus on newer generation compounds.	Using radioligand binding assays and post-mortem normal human brain tissue, we obtained equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)s) for nine new antipsychotic drugs (iloperidone, melperone, olanzapine, ORG 5222, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine), one metabolite of a new drug (9-OH-risperidone), and three older antipsychotics (clozapine, haloperidol, and pimozide) at nine different receptors (alpha1-adrenergic, alpha2-adrenergic, dopamine D2, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors). Iloperidone was the most potent drug at the two adrenergic receptors. ORG 5222 was the most potent drug at dopamine D2 and 5-HT2c receptors, while ziprasidone was the most potent compound at three serotonergic receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT2A). At the remaining two receptors, olanzapine was the most potent drug at the histamine H1 receptor (Kd=0.087 nM); clozapine at the muscarinic receptor (Kd=9 nM). Certain therapeutic and adverse effects, as well as certain drug interactions can be predicted from a drug's potency for blocking a specific receptor. These data can provide guidelines for the clinician in the choice of antipsychotic drug.
11153163	Renal damage induced by the treatment with non-opioid analgesics--theoretical assumption or clinical significance.	Non-opioid analgesics are some of the most widely used therapeutic agents in clinical practice today. The number of patients at risk for adverse events related to the use of these agents is rapidly expanding. While the gastrointestinal toxicity of these medications is well known, it has become increasingly apparent that the kidney is also an important target for untoward clinical events. Evidence of the nephrotoxicity of analgesic preparations is not sufficiently completed and available in our region. Analgesic-related renal injury has been classified based on mechanism of action into "classic" analgesic nephropathy and NSAID-related renal toxicity. From clinical point of view the renal side effects induced by analgesics can be classified into hemodynamic (functional) side effects and idiosyncratic side effects. The common link in both types of side effects seems to be renal ischemia related to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. Key enzyme in this process is cyclooxygenase occurring in two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. Antiinflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by COX-2 inhibition, while the side effects (gastrotoxicity, nephrotoxicity) by inhibition of COX-1. COX-1 was more inhibited by indomethacin and piroxicam and COX-2 by 6-MNA (active metabolite of nabumetone), diclofenac and ibuprofen. Nimesulide and meloxicam selectively block COX-2 and are recommended to patients at risk or treated with diuretics. (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 38.)
11164846	Antiarrhythmic drug carvedilol inhibits HERG potassium channels.	The aryloxypropanolamine carvedilol is a multiple action cardiovascular drug with blocking effects on alpha-receptors, beta-receptors, Ca(2+)-channels, Na(+)-channels and various native cardiac K(+) channels, thereby prolonging the cardiac action potential. In a number of clinical trials with patients suffering from congestive heart failure, carvedilol appeared to be superior to other beta-blocking agents in reducing total mortality. Given the multiple pharmacological actions of carvedilol, this may be due to specific channel blockade rather than beta-antagonistic activity. Since human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) K(+)channels play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, the effects of carvedilol on HERG K(+)channels were investigated.
11166283	[3H]dofetilide binding in SHSY5Y and HEK293 cells expressing a HERG-like K+ channel?	The pharmacological characteristics of [3H]dofetilide binding in SHSY5Y, HEK293 and CHO-K1 cells were examined, and in parallel whole cell recordings used to characterise HERG-like K+ currents. Dofetilide affinity was similar in the human cell lines, SHSY5Y (Kd=99.6 nM) and HEK293 (Kd=102.9 nM), but 10 times lower in CHO-K1 cells (Kd=1200 nM). In contrast, clofilium and E4031 had a similar affinity in all three cell lines, whereas WAY 123,398 had no effect. Electrophysiological studies showed that SHSY5Y cells contained a HERG-like K+ current blocked by application of dofetilide to either side of the membrane. Block was faster when dofetilide was applied intracellularly. In contrast, HEK293 and CHO-K1 cells contained no such current, despite the presence of a partial cDNA for HERG in the former. That [3H]dofetilide is specific for I(Kr)/HERG may be questionable, as HEK293 and CHO-K1 cells contain no such functional K+ current.
11172467	The ligands/activators for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PPARgamma increase Cu2+,Zn2+-superoxide dismutase and decrease p22phox message expressions in primary endothelial cells.	We examined the effects of a variety of ligands/activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) on the expression of the superoxide scavenger enzyme, Cu2+,Zn2+-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), and the superoxide generating enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) (NADPH) oxidase in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aorta endothelial cells (HAEC). Our data show that 3 types of PPARs, PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta/Nuc1, and PPARgamma are expressed in endothelial cells. Bezafibrate, which is a ligand/activator for PPARalpha, increased the CuZn-SOD gene expression and protein levels in endothelial cells. Troglitazone and pioglitazone, which are ligands/activators for PPARgamma, also induced PPARalpha gene and protein expression and increased CuZn-SOD gene expression and protein levels in addition to increasing PPARgamma gene and protein expression in endothelial cells. Moreover, with treatment of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the CuZn-SOD mRNA levels were positively correlated with PPARalpha mRNA levels (r = .872, P < .0001) in primary endothelial cells. In addition, the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated or PMA-nonstimulated 22-kd a-subunit (p22phox) mRNA levels and 47-kd a-subunit (p47phox) protein levels in NADPH oxidase were decreased by treatment with PPARalpha and PPARgamma ligands/activators. These results suggest that PPARalpha and PPARgamma gene and protein expression in endothelial cells may play a physiologic role as radical scavengers, although the details of these mechanisms remain to be established.
11180498	Compensatory responses in the aging hippocampal serotonergic system following neurodegenerative injury with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine.	This study utilized a multidisciplinary approach to examine injury-induced compensatory responses in the aging hippocampal serotonin transporter (5-HTT), a membrane protein implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Age-dependent cellular, anatomical, and physiological changes of the 5-HTT were evaluated in female Fischer 344 rats (2 and 17 months) following denervation of the serotonergic afferents (fimbria-fornix and cingulum bundle) to the dorsal hippocampus using the neurotoxicant 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Seven days following 5,7-DHT administration, a uniform loss of the hippocampal 5-HTT immunoreactivity was observed in both age groups. However, at 21 days 5-HTT immunoreactivity in young 5,7-DHT-treated animals was similar to control levels, indicative of recovery, while older animals exposed to 5,7-DHT did not show recovery of hippocampal 5-HTT expression. 5-HTT binding site density, as determined by quantitative autoradiography ([3H]citalopram), supported the immunohistochemical results by demonstrating a recovery of 5-HTT binding sites in young, but not old animals, at 21 days following the lesion (P < 0.001). Furthermore, cellular electrophysiological function of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in 3- and 18-month-old F344 rats at 21 days following 5,7-DHT or vehicle treatment were assessed using in vivo microiontophoretic application of serotonin (5-HT). Independent of changes in sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of 5-HT application, the time to recovery of cell firing following application of 5-HT was significantly increased in the 18-month 5,7-DHT group compared to the 18-month vehicle and 3-month 5,7-DHT groups (60 and 59% increases, respectively; P < 0.05). Overall, these series of studies comprise a model which can be used to identify cellular events underlying both the formation of injury-induced compensatory processes in younger animals and the lack thereof with advancing age.
11204352	Association study of a cannabinoid receptor gene (CNR1) polymorphism and schizophrenia.	Cannabis can induce schizophrenic-like symptoms in healthy individuals. A principal active ingredient of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, acts in the brain on a specific receptor, termed the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1). The human gene for CNR1 is mapped to chromosome 6q14-15, and linkage studies have produced evidence for a schizophrenia-susceptibility locus in this region. To explore a possible role for CNR1 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders, we used an association study to genotype the CNR1 polymorphism for 127 schizophrenic patients and 146 control subjects. The results demonstrate no association between CNR1 genotypes and schizophrenic disorders (P = 0.409), with these negative findings suggesting that, for Chinese populations, the (AAT)n triplet repeat in the promoter region of the CNR1 gene is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders.
11218067	5HT4(a) and 5-HT4(b) receptors have nearly identical pharmacology and are both expressed in human atrium and ventricle.	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) increases human heart rate and atrial contractile force and hastens atrial relaxation through 5-HT4 receptors. Moreover, 5-HT may be arrhythmogenic and give rise to atrial fibrillation. It is not clear which splice variant(s) of the 5-HT4 receptor is expressed and mediates these effects of 5-HT in the human heart. Previous studies have indicated different pharmacological properties of 5-HT4 receptors in human heart and mouse colliculi neurones, possibly due to expression of different splice variants. We therefore cloned the human 5-HT4(b) receptor and compared its pharmacological properties with those of the cloned human 5-HT4(a) receptor and searched for the corresponding mRNA in human tissues. The primary structures of the two human 5-HT4 receptor splice variants are identical except for divergent C-terminal tails of 28 and 29 amino acids in the 5-HT4(a) and 5-HT4(b) receptors, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that both variants were coexpressed in various tissues, including cardiac atrium and ventricle. Additional bands suggested the presence of more than two human 5-HT4 receptor splice variants. With cloned receptors stably expressed in HEK293 cells or transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, [3H]GR 113808 consistently showed slightly higher binding affinity to h5-HT4(b) than to h5-HT4(a) receptor (pKd 0.1-0.2 log units higher). Competition of agonists, partial agonists and antagonists for [3H]GR113808 binding revealed no significant differences between the two receptors. For 5-HT4 receptor agonists and antagonists, their potencies in stimulating or inhibiting, respectively, 5-HT-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity correlated well with their binding affinities. Tropisetron and SB207710 showed partial agonist activity at high receptor expression levels for both isoforms. Cisapride and renzapride were both partial agonists at moderate receptor levels and full agonists at high receptor levels. Cisapride was more potent than renzapride while the converse was the case in human atrium, for which cisapride had lower affinity and agonist potency than at the recombinant receptors. The binding affinities and agonist potencies of ligands for both 5-HT4(a) and 5-HT4(b) receptors correlated with the corresponding affinities and potencies in human atrium. The agonist potency of SB207710 was around 10 times lower than its binding and blocking affinity for both splice variants, suggesting that activation of adenylyl cyclase and blockade of 5-HT responses are mediated through different conformational states. The similar pharmacological properties of the two human 5-HT4 receptor splice variants together with their expression in human atrium would be consistent with mediation of the cardiostimulant effects of 5-HT through both variants. However, the effects of cisapride appear either mediated through non-a and non-b splice variants of the 5-HT4 receptor or 5-HT4(a) and 5-HT4(b) receptor expression in human atrial cells alters somewhat their pharmacological profile through still unknown mechanisms.
11222668	Dopaminergic role in stimulant-induced wakefulness.	The role of dopamine in sleep regulation and in mediating the effects of wake-promoting therapeutics is controversial. In this study, polygraphic recordings and caudate microdialysate dopamine measurements in narcoleptic dogs revealed that the wake-promoting antinarcoleptic compounds modafinil and amphetamine increase extracellular dopamine in a hypocretin receptor 2-independent manner. In mice, deletion of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene reduced non-rapid eye movement sleep time and increased wakefulness consolidation independently from locomotor effects. DAT knock-out mice were also unresponsive to the normally robust wake-promoting action of modafinil, methamphetamine, and the selective DAT blocker GBR12909 but were hypersensitive to the wake-promoting effects of caffeine. Thus, dopamine transporters play an important role in sleep regulation and are necessary for the specific wake-promoting action of amphetamines and modafinil.
11245456	Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid synthase activity produces both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects modulated by p53.	Fatty acid synthetic metabolism is abnormally elevated in tumor cells, and pharmacological inhibitors of the anabolic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS), including the natural product cerulenin and the novel synthetic compound c75, are selective inhibitors of tumor cell growth. We have recently reported that these two FAS inhibitors both produce rapid, potent inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in human cancer cells, as well as apoptotic death. Here we report an additional characterization of the cellular response to FAS inhibition. RKO colon carcinoma cells were selected for study because they undergo little apoptosis within the first 24 h after FAS inhibition. Instead, RKO cells exhibited a biphasic stress response with a transient accumulation in S and G2 at 4 and 8 h that corresponds to a marked reduction in cyclin A- and B1-associated kinase activities, and then by accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins at 16 and 24 h and growth arrest in G1 and G2. The response of RKO cells to FAS inhibition resembled a genotoxic stress response, but DNA damage did not appear to be an important downstream effect of FAS inhibition, because none was detected using the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) to assess DNA damage. p53 function is probably important in protecting RKO cells from FAS inhibition because, similar to many other tumor lines, RKO cells expressing a dominant negative mutant p53 gene underwent extensive apoptosis within 24 h after FAS inhibition. Sensitization of cells to FAS inhibitors by the loss of p53 raises the possibility that these agents may be clinically useful against malignancies carrying p53 mutations. Whereas induction of apoptosis appeared related to accumulation of the substrate, malonyl-CoA, after FAS inhibition, the cytostatic effects were independent of malonyl-CoA accumulation and may have resulted from product depletion.
11245463	Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis by sulindac metabolites.	Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and sulindac is associated with a decreased mortality from colorectal cancer. Sulindac causes regression of precancerous adenomatous polyps and inhibits the growth of cultured colon cell lines. Whereas induction of apoptotic cell death is thought to account for the growth inhibitory effect of sulindac, less is known about its biochemical mechanism(s) of action. Sulindac is metabolized in vivo to sulfide and sulfone derivatives. Both the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of sulindac as well as more potent cyclic GMP-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitors were shown to cause inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation at doses (40-600 microM) and times (1-5 days) consistent with the induction of apoptosis by the drugs. Treatment of HCT116 human colon cancer cells with the specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, U0126 (5-50 microM) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis. U0126 treatment (20 microM) increased basal apoptosis, and potentiated the apoptotic effect of sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone. These results suggest that the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is responsible for at least part of the induction of programmed cell death by sulindac metabolites. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity may, therefore, be a useful biochemical target for the development of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic drugs for human colon cancer.
11247671	Synergy between tetA and rpsL provides high-stringency positive and negative selection in bacterial artificial chromosome vectors.	Bacterial artificial chromosome (bacmid) vectors are used to stably propagate large, complex fragments of cloned DNA and are a core technology for functional genomics. The simplest method of analyzing bacmid clones would involve a direct mutagenesis or allele exchange protocol utilizing positive and negative selectable markers. The utility of three different negative selectable markers to function in the context of a bacmid vector was therefore investigated: sacB from Bacillus subtilis, which confers sensitivity to sucrose; tetA from TN10, which confers resistance to tetracycline, osmotic sensitivity, and sensitivity to kanamycin and streptomycin; and rpsL from Escherichia coli, which confers sensitivity to streptomycin. When expressed individually in the context of a bacmid vector, each of these markers confers a similar stringency of negative selection, with plating efficiencies on selective media of 2.3 x 10(-5), 9.4 x 10(-4), and 5.7 x 10(-5), respectively. However coexpression of rpsL and tetA results in a synergistic enhancement of the osmotic, kanamycin, and streptomycin sensitivities, with a stringency of selection of approximately 50- to approximately 1000-fold over that obtained with rpsL or tetA alone and approximately 20-fold more than that obtained using sacB. The combination of rpsL and tetA thus serves as the most efficient positive and negative selectable marker system described to date.
11248372	Differential sensitivity to NaCl for inhibitors and substrates that recognize mutually exclusive binding sites on the neuronal transporter of dopamine in rat striatal membranes.	Addition of NaCl (90--290 mM) to a 10 mM Na(+) medium did not significantly modify B(max) and K(d) values for [3H]mazindol binding to the dopamine neuronal transporter (DAT) studied on rat striatal membranes at 20 degrees C. Addition of NaCl differentially affected the ability of other uptake inhibitors and substrates to block the [3H]mazindol binding. Ratios of 50% inhibiting concentrations calculated for 290 and 90 mM NaCl allowed to distinguish three groups of agents: substrates which were more potent in the presence of 290 mM NaCl (group 1; ratio < 1) and two groups of uptake inhibitors displaying ratio values either ranging around two (group 2: WIN 35,428, cocaine, methylphenidate, pyrovalerone) or close to unity (group 3: BTCP, mazindol, benztropine, nomifensine). However, agents from these three groups recognize mutually exclusive binding sites since in interaction studies the presence of WIN 35,428 (group 2) or mazindol (group 3) increased the 50% inhibiting concentrations of D-amphetamine (group 1) and WIN 35,428 on the [3H]mazindol binding to theoretical values expected for a competition of all of these compounds for the same binding domain on the DAT.
11258648	Effects of topical budesonide treatment on glucocorticoid receptor mRNA down-regulation and cytokine patterns in nasal polyps.	The effects of a topically applied corticosteroid, budesonide, on the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine patterns in patients with nasal polyps were evaluated. All patients were eligible for surgical polypectomy, and a majority of them had been treated with nasal steroids. Patients were given 400 microg b.i.d. (group A, n = 11), 200 microg b.i.d. (group B, n = 10), or no treatment (group C, n = 15) during two months before polypectomy. Morning serum cortisol was analyzed on the day of surgery. Surgically removed polyps were taken for analysis of GR mRNA expression by solution hybridization. Remaining tissue was cryostat-sectioned, whereafter quantification of the cytokines interleukin 1beta, interleukin 2, interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma was made by immunohistochemistry and digitized image analysis. No significant differences among the three groups were found for any of the parameters investigated.
11259539	Dexfenfluramine-associated changes in 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter expression and development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in rats.	The appetite suppressant dexfenfluramine, which inhibits neuronal 5-HT uptake and elevates plasma 5-HT levels, has been associated with an increase in the relative risk of developing primary pulmonary hypertension. 5-HT is a mitogen for pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs), an effect that depends upon activity of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). To investigate the relationship between dexfenfluramine and pulmonary hypertension, we examined 1) the effect of dexfenfluramine on 5-HT uptake by PA-SMCs and the mitogenic response of these cells to 5-HT, and 2) 5-HTT mRNA in lung tissue from normoxic and chronically hypoxic rats during and at discontinuation of a 4-week dexfenfluramine treatment (2 mg/kg/day). In cultured PA-SMCs, dexfenfluramine (10(-6) M) markedly reduced [3H]5-HT uptake and [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to 5-HT (10(-6) M). In lungs from rats exposed to 4-week hypoxia (10% O(2)), 5-HTT mRNA levels were higher than in normoxic rats (233.5 +/- 22.5 versus 121.8 +/- 4.8 amol/mg of RNA, P < 0.05), but were not affected by concomitant treatment with dexfenfluramine. One week after discontinuation of dexfenfluramine, 5-HTT mRNA levels increased substantially, this effect being additive with that of hypoxia (364.0 +/- 13.1 in hypoxic versus 164.2 +/- 10 amol/mg of RNA in normoxic rats). When exposure to 2 weeks of hypoxia followed discontinuation of a 4-week treatment, right ventricular hypertrophy was more severe and muscularization of distal pulmonary arteries more marked (P < 0.01) than in rats pretreated with the vehicle. These data show that, in rats, the increased 5-HTT expression that follows dexfenfluramine discontinuation promotes the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.
11271412	Following long-term training with citalopram, both mirtazapine and mianserin block its discriminative stimulus properties in rats.	The discriminative stimulus (DS) properties of the selective serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, are mediated by 5-HT2C receptors. Interestingly, the "atypical" antidepressants, mianserin and mirtazapine, behave as antagonists at 5-HT2C receptors.
11275997	Tumor invasiveness and liver metastasis of colon cancer cells correlated with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and inhibited by a COX-2-selective inhibitor, etodolac.	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to reduce the risk and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) by NSAIDs appears to abort, if not prevent, CRC carcinogenesis or metastatic tumor progression. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between COX-2 expression and CRC tumor cell invasiveness. The differences in immunoblot-detectable COX-2 protein contents in primary CRCs, metastatic hepatic lesions and corresponding normal mucosa from the same individual were evaluated in 17 patients. Three different colon cancer cell lines, SW620, Lovo, HT-29 and a metastatic variant of HT-29, HT-29/Inv3, were employed to evaluate COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE2) production in relation to their invasive abilities in vitro. The effects of a COX-2-selective inhibitor, etodolac, on cell proliferation and invasive activity were also determined. The results showed that 15 of 17 (88%) metastatic CRC cells from the liver and 14 of 17 (82%) primary CRC tissue exhibited much higher levels of COX-2 than corresponding adjacent normal mucosa from the same patient. Among those patients with relatively high COX-2 expression in the primary tumors, almost all exhibited even higher levels of COX-2 in their hepatic metastases. Among the 4 colon cancer cell lines, HT-29/Inv3 manifested the highest COX-2 expression, PGE2 production and in vitro invasive activity. The selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, could especially exert cytotoxicity and markedly suppress the invasive property and PGE(2) production, although not the COX-2 protein level, in HT-29/Inv3 cells. Our results imply that COX-2 expression may be associated with the invasive and metastatic properties of CRC tumor cells.
11277529	Effects of two-carbon bridge region methoxylation of benztropine: discovery of novel chiral ligands for the dopamine transporter.	6-Methoxylated and 8-oxygenated benztropines were prepared and evaluated for their DAT and SERT activity (binding and uptake inhibition). Methoxylation at the two-carbon bridge of benztropine produced a novel class of potent and selective DAT ligands. An interesting enantioselectivity was also observed for this new class of chiral benztropines. The inactivity of the 8-oxygenated analogues seems to point out that, unlike cocaine and its analogues, interactions of benztropine ligands with DAT may be strongly governed by the nitrogen atom.
11290327	Structural mechanism for rifampicin inhibition of bacterial rna polymerase.	Rifampicin (Rif) is one of the most potent and broad spectrum antibiotics against bacterial pathogens and is a key component of anti-tuberculosis therapy, stemming from its inhibition of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). We determined the crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNAP complexed with Rif. The inhibitor binds in a pocket of the RNAP beta subunit deep within the DNA/RNA channel, but more than 12 A away from the active site. The structure, combined with biochemical results, explains the effects of Rif on RNAP function and indicates that the inhibitor acts by directly blocking the path of the elongating RNA when the transcript becomes 2 to 3 nt in length.
11295178	Kinetic properties of dihydrofolate reductase from wild-type and mutant Plasmodium vivax expressed in Escherichia coli.	Antifolate drugs inhibit malarial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In Plasmodium falciparum, antifolate resistance has been associated with point mutations in the gene encoding DHFR. Recently, mutations at homologous positions have been observed in the P. vivax gene. Since P. vivax cannot be propagated in a continuous in vitro culture for drug sensitivity assays, the kinetic properties of DHFR were studied by expression of the DHFR domain in Escherichia coli. Induced expression yielded a protein product that precipitated as an inclusion body in E. coli. The soluble, active DHFR recovered after denaturation and renaturation was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Kinetic properties of the recombinant P. vivax DHFR showed that the wild-type DHFR (Ser-58 and Ser-117) and double mutant DHFR (Arg-58 and Asn-117) have similar K(m) values for dihydrofolate and NADPH. Antifolate drugs (pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, trimethoprim, and methotrexate), but not proguanil (parent compound of cycloguanil) inhibit DHFR activity, as expected. The kinetics of enzyme inhibition indicated that point mutations (Ser58Arg and Ser117Asn) are associated with lower affinity between the mutant enzyme and pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, which may be the origin of antifolate resistance.
11296551	[Blockade of HERG K+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes by antipsychotic agents].	We have investigated the effects of neuroleptic agents, haloperidol, pimozide and fluspirilen, that are used in clinics to treat psychiatric disorders, but reportedly have proarrhythmic side effects, on HERG-encoded K+ channels responsible for the rapid component of cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, IKr. All three agents blocked HERG-directed IKr in Xenopus oocytes in a voltage-dependent manner. The extent of the blockade increased with depolarization correlating with channels activation consistent with open-channel blocking mechanism. The IC50 values for the haloperidol-, pimozide- and fluspirilen-induced blockade of fully activated IKr were 1.36, 1.74 and 2.34 mcM respectively. Neuroleptics did not affect the HERG channels steady-state activation and inactivation properties. Thus, the blockade of HERG channels may underly proarrhythmic actions of neuroleptics resulting in a slowing down of the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential, and prolongation of the electrocardiographic QT interval.
11300648	Comparison of a vasopeptidase inhibitor with neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on bradykinin metabolism in the rat coronary bed.	The in vitro effects of omapatrilat, a dual vasopeptidase inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), on exogenous bradykinin metabolism after a single passage through the coronary bed were compared with that of a NEP inhibitor (retrothiorphan, 25 nM), an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat, 130 nM), and omapatrilat (25 nM). Bradykinin and inhibitors were infused into isolated Langendorff rat hearts perfused at 1 ml/min followed by reperfusion at 10 ml/min. Residual bradykinin was quantified in the coronary effluent by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to calculate bradykinin recovery and its kinetic parameters (Vmax/Km). Bradykinin degradation rate at 1 ml/min was 4.56 +/- 0.39 1/min per gram without inhibitors and was significantly reduced to 2.57 +/- 0.19 1/min per gram in the presence of enalaprilat, to 2.97 +/- 0.38 1/min per gram with retrothiorphan, to 1.82 +/- 0.17 1/min per gram with both enalaprilat and retrothiorphan, and to 1.14 +/- 0.35 1/min per gram with omapatrilat. In a second set of experiments, the effect of a 14-day treatment of rats with either ACE inhibitors (enalapril, quinapril, and ramipril), a NEP inhibitor (candoxatril), or omapatrilat on exogenous bradykinin metabolism was studied in Langendorff perfused hearts isolated from these long-term treated rats. In untreated rats, bradykinin degradation at a coronary perfusion of 1 ml/min was 4.35 +/- 0.41 1/min per gram. This value was reduced by 30% for the NEP inhibitor, by 50% for all ACE inhibitors, and by 75% for omapatrilat. All inhibitors administered either short term or long term significantly reduced bradykinin degradation during a single passage through the coronary bed. However, omapatrilat administration resulted in the greatest protection from bradykinin breakdown than ACE or NEP inhibitors alone.
11300876	Structure-activity relationship studies of 4-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl]-1-benzylpiperidine derivatives and their N-analogues: evaluation of O-and N-analogues and their binding to monoamine transporters.	In our effort to develop a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of cocaine addiction, we embarked on synthesizing novel molecules targeting the dopamine transporter (DAT) molecule in the brain as DAT has been implicated strongly in the reinforcing effect of cocaine. Our previously developed DAT-selective piperidine analogue, 4-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl]-1-benzylpiperidine, was the basis for our current structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies exploring the significance of the contribution of the benzhydryl O- and N-atoms in these molecules in interacting with the DAT. Thus, we replaced the benzhydryl O-atom with an N-atom, altered the location of the benzhydryl N-atom to an adjacent position, and in one other occasion converted the benzhydryl O-ether linkage into an oxime-type derivative. Furthermore, we also evaluated the important contribution of the piperidine N-atom to binding by altering its pK(a) value chemically. Novel analogues were tested for potency in inhibiting [3H]WIN 35,428, [3H]citalopram, and [3H]nisoxetine binding at the DAT, serotonin transporter (SERT), and norepinepherine transporter (NET). [3H]DA was used to measure DA reuptake inhibition. The results indicated that the benzhydryl O- and N-atoms are exchangeable for the most part. On the other hand, an enhanced interaction with the SERT was observed when the benzhydryl N-atom moved to an adjacent position (21a; DAT (IC(50)) = 19.7, SERT (IC(50)) = 137 nM, NET (IC(50)) = 1111 nM). In either cases, further alkylation of the N-atom reduced the activity for the transporter. The presence of a powerful electron-withdrawing cyano group in compound 5d expectedly produced the most potent and selective ligand for the DAT (DAT (IC(50)) = 3.7 nM, DAT/SERT = 615). Selected compounds were further analyzed in the dopamine reuptake inhibition assay. Preliminary behavioral assessment of some of the selected compounds in mice indicated that these compounds are much less stimulating when compared with cocaine at comparable doses. In drug-discrimination studies these selected compounds incompletely generalized from the cocaine stimulus in mice trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from vehicle.
11302941	Involvement of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase in tresperimus metabolism in human and in rat.	The metabolism of tresperimus, a new immunosuppressive agent, was investigated in vivo and in vitro in rat and in human. Two metabolic pathways were identified at each side of the molecule with two deamination reactions on the spermidine moiety and hydrolysis of the amide bond leading to the liberation of guanidinohexylamine. As the major metabolic pathway of the drug seemed to be the oxidative deamination, the capacity of different amine oxidases to metabolize tresperimus was then tested using in vivo experiments in rat and in vitro studies in rat and human plasma. The increase of tresperimus plasma levels induced by the administration of hydralazine, an irreversible in vivo inhibitor of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), reflected the major involvement of this enzyme in tresperimus metabolism. This result was confirmed in vitro in rat and human plasma by the use of semicarbazide, a specific SSAO inhibitor. As opposed to rat plasma, human plasma may be an interesting in vitro model to study the metabolism of a drug extensively metabolized by SSAO such as tresperimus. Indeed, SSAO activity was significantly higher in human plasma than in rat plasma. The second metabolic pathway of the drug, which only occurred in rat plasma, appeared thus as the major route of tresperimus metabolism in this biological matrix.
11304754	Effects of aging on serotonin transporter availability and its response to fluvoxamine in the living brain: PET study with [(11)C](+)McN5652 and [(11)C](-)McN5652 in conscious monkeys.	Age-related changes in the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the living brains of conscious young (5.9 +/- 1.8 years old) and aged (19.0 +/- 3.3 years old) monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were evaluated in combination with [(11)C](+)McN5652 and its inactive enantiomer [(11)C](-)McN5652 by high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET). For the quantitative analysis of SERT binding in vivo, two serial PET scans with [(11)C](+)McN5652 and [(11)C](-)McN5652 were performed in the same animals in a day and the differences in radioactivities of [(11)C](+)McN5652 vs. [(11)C](-)McN5652 measured from 41-91 min postinjection were calculated as an estimate of specific ligand binding. Higher specific binding of SERT was observed in the thalamus and striatum, regions known to contain high densities of SERT by in vitro assay, with intermediate levels in the pons, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and cortical regions and lower levels in the cerebellum in both young and aged monkeys. Almost all regions assayed except the cerebellum showed significant age-related decreases in the specific binding of SERT, which showed reverse correlation with cortisol level in plasma. When the SERT blocker fluvoxamine (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 min after tracer injection, specific binding of SERT was displaced in both age groups. However, the degree of displacement was more marked in young than in aged monkeys. Cortisol level in plasma was significantly higher in aged than in young animals. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of the combined use of [(11)C](+)McN5652 and [(11)C](-)McN5652 as an indicator for the age-related changes in cortical SERT measured noninvasively by PET. In addition, these observations suggest that the age-related impairment of SERT sensitivity for fluvoxamine might be related to the reduced efficacy of antidepressant therapy in elderly patients with depression.
11313435	Repetitive nerve stimulation decreases the acetylcholine content of quanta at the frog neuromuscular junction.	We investigated how elevated quantal release produced by motor nerve stimulation affects the size of the quanta. The motor nerve was stimulated at 10 Hz in preparations in which excitation-contraction coupling was disrupted. Two hundred stimuli reduced the size of the time integrals of the miniature endplate currents ([integral]MEPCs), measured at the same junction immediately after stimulation, by 16 %. Three thousand stimuli reduced size by 23 %. When the solution contained 10 microM neostigmine (NEO) 3000 stimuli reduced [integral]MEPCs by 60 %, because with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited, [integral]MEPC size is more sensitive to changes in acetylcholine (ACh) content. Similar decreases in miniature endplate potential size ([integral]MEPP) followed repetitive stimulation of contracting preparations. The depolarization produced by iontophoretic pulses of ACh was scarcely changed by 3000 nerve stimuli at 10 Hz, suggesting that the decreases in miniature sizes are largely due to less ACh released per quantum. Following 3000 stimuli at 10 Hz the sizes of the [integral]MEPCs increased back to pre-stimulus values with a half-time of 8-10 min. Recovery was blocked by (-)-vesamicol (VES), by hemicholinium-3 (HC3) and by nicotinic cholinergic agonists - all of which inhibit ACh loading into synaptic vesicles. The number of quanta in the total store was estimated by releasing them with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). CCCP releases fewer quanta after stimulation than from unstimulated controls. After resting for hours following stimulation, the releasable number increased, even when ACh loading inhibitors were present. We conclude that the inhibitors do not block a significant fraction of the ACh loading into reformed reserve vesicles and propose that ACh can be loaded in a series of steps.
11319222	Expression and characterization of recombinant rat Acyl-CoA synthetases 1, 4, and 5. Selective inhibition by triacsin C and thiazolidinediones.	Inhibition by triacsins and troglitazone of long chain fatty acid incorporation into cellular lipids suggests the existence of inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS, EC ) that are linked to specific metabolic pathways. In order to test this hypothesis, we cloned and purified rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5, the isoforms present in liver and fat cells, expressed the isoforms as ACS-Flag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and purified them by Flag affinity chromatography. The Flag epitope at the C terminus did not alter the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Purified ACS1-, 4-, and 5-Flag isoforms differed in their apparent K(m) values for ATP, thermolability, pH optima, requirement for Triton X-100, and sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and phenylglyoxal. The ACS inhibitor triacsin C strongly inhibited ACS1 and ACS4, but not ACS5. The thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin-sensitizing drugs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, strongly and specifically inhibited only ACS4, with an IC(50) of less than 1.5 microm. Troglitazone exhibited a mixed type inhibition of ACS4. alpha-Tocopherol, whose ring structure forms the non-TZD portion of troglitazone, did not inhibit ACS4, indicating that the thiazolidine-2,4-dione moiety is the critical component for inhibition. A non-TZD PPARgamma ligand, GW1929, which is 7-fold more potent than rosiglitazone, inhibited ACS1 and ACS4 poorly with an IC(50) of greater than 50 microm, more than 100-fold higher than was required for rosiglitazone, thereby demonstrating the specificity of TZD inhibition. Further, the PPARalpha ligands, clofibrate and GW4647, and various xenobiotic carboxylic acids known to be incorporated into complex lipids had no effect on ACS1, -4, or -5. These results, together with previous data showing that triacsin C and troglitazone strongly inhibit triacylglycerol synthesis compared with other metabolic pathways, suggest that ACS1 and ACS4 catalyze the synthesis of acyl-CoAs used for triacylglycerol synthesis and that lack of inhibition of a metabolic pathway by triacsin C does not prove lack of acyl-CoA involvement. The results further suggest the possibility that the insulin-sensitizing effects of the thiazolidinedione drugs might be achieved, in part, through direct interaction with ACS4 in a PPARgamma-independent manner.
11320369	ADEPT: Addition of the AT1 receptor antagonist eprosartan to ACE inhibitor therapy in chronic heart failure trial: hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects.	Persistent activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is known to occur in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) despite treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) therapy. When added to ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) antagonists may allow more complete blockade of the RAAS and preserve the beneficial effects of bradykinin accumulation not seen with AT1 receptor blockade alone.
11325413	The effect of (R)-HA966 or ACEA 1021 on dexfenfluramine or (S)-MDMA-induced changes in temperature, activity, and neurotoxicity.	The glycine site-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 5-nitro-6,7-dichloro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (ACEA 1021, 4x30 mg/kg, i.p.) given 30 min before dexfenfluramine (4x15 mg/kg, i.p., every 2 h) was unable to prevent dexfenfluramine-induced depletion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) content, and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) density. Another glycine site-specific NMDA antagonist, R(+)-3-aminohydroxypyrrolidin-2-one [(R)-HA 966] (2x30 mg/kg, ip), given 30 min before dexfenfluramine (2x10 mg/kg, ip, 2 hourly) was also unable to prevent regional depletion of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and 5-HTT density. However, ACEA 1021 (4x30 mg/kg, i.p.) given 30 min before (S)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 4x10 mg/kg, 2 hourly, ip) attenuated the regional depletion of dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 5-HT, 5-HIAA content, and 5-HTT density. ACEA 1021 combined with (S)-MDMA also prevented (S)-MDMA-induced hyperthermia without causing hypothermia or preventing an (S)-MDMA-induced increase in locomotor activity.
11325810	Glimepiride block of cloned beta-cell, cardiac and smooth muscle K(ATP) channels.	1. We examined the effect of the sulphonylurea glimepiride on three types of recombinant ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. 2. K(ATP) channels share a common pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2, which associates with different sulphonylurea receptor isoforms (SUR1 in beta-cells, SUR2A in heart and SUR2B in smooth muscle). 3. Kir6.2 was coexpressed with SUR1, SUR2A or SUR2B in Xenopus oocytes and macroscopic K(ATP) currents were recorded from giant inside-out membrane patches. Glimepiride was added to the intracellular membrane surface. 4. Glimepiride inhibited Kir6.2/SUR currents by interaction with two sites: a low-affinity site on Kir6.2 (IC(50)= approximately 400 microM) and a high-affinity site on SUR (IC(50)=3.0 nM for SUR1, 5.4 nM for SUR2A and 7.3 nM for SUR2B). The potency of glimepiride at the high-affinity site is close to that observed for glibenclamide (4 nM for SUR1, 27 nM for SUR2A), which has a similar structure. 5. Glimepiride inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR2B currents, but not Kir6.2/SUR1 currents, reversed rapidly. 6. Our results indicate that glimepiride is a high-affinity sulphonylurea that does not select between the beta-cell, cardiac and smooth muscle types of recombinant K(ATP) channel, when measured in inside-out patches. High-affinity inhibition is mediated by interaction of the drug with the sulphonylurea receptor subunit of the channel.
11325930	Response of Bacillus subtilis to cerulenin and acquisition of resistance.	Cerulenin is a fungal mycotoxin that potently inhibits fatty acid synthesis by covalent modification of the active site thiol of the chain-elongation subtypes of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases. The Bacillus subtilis fabF (yjaY) gene (fabF(b)) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-ACP with acyl-ACP to extend the growing acyl chain by two carbons. There were two mechanisms by which B. subtilis adapted to exposure to this antibiotic. First, reporter gene analysis demonstrated that transcription of the operon containing the fabF gene increased eightfold in response to a cerulenin challenge. This response was selective for the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, since triclosan, an inhibitor of enoyl-ACP reductase, triggered an increase in fabF reporter gene expression while nalidixic acid did not. Second, spontaneous mutants arose that exhibited a 10-fold increase in the MIC of cerulenin. The mutation mapped at the B. subtilis fabF locus, and sequence analysis of the mutant fabF allele showed that a single base change resulted in the synthesis of FabF(b)[I108F]. The purified FabF(b) and FabF(b)[I108F] proteins had similar specific activities with myristoyl-ACP as the substrate. FabF(b) exhibited a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of cerulenin of 0.1 microM, whereas the IC(50) for FabF(b)[I108] was 50-fold higher (5 microM). These biochemical data explain the absence of an overt growth defect coupled with the cerulenin resistance phenotype of the mutant strain.
11329095	The hemodynamic effects of long-term ACE inhibition with fosinopril in patients with heart failure. Fosinopril Hemodynamics Study Group.	The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and clinical effects of fosinopril in patients with heart failure. This was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Patients 18 to 80 years of age who were receiving diuretics with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 90 mm Hg, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) > or = 18 mm Hg, and a cardiac index (CI) < or = 2.6 L/min/m(2) were eligible. A total of 179 patients were randomized to a single, double-blind oral dose of placebo or fosinopril at 1, 20, or 40 mg, and hemodynamic monitoring was performed for 24 hours postdose; 155 patients with SBP > or = 90 mm Hg were re-randomized to 10 weeks of double-blind fosinopril at 1, 20, or 40 mg once daily. Hemodynamic monitoring was repeated at the last visit, beginning at 24 hours postdose (trough) and continuing for 12 hours thereafter. Significant decreases in preload (PCWP) and afterload (mean arterial blood pressure [MABP] and systemic vascular resistance [SVR]) were evident 3 to 4 hours after a single dose of fosinopril at 20 and 40 mg and continuing for up to 8 to 12 hours postdose for PCWP and SVR and for up to 24 hours postdose for MABP (P < or = .05 v placebo and baseline). Sustained decreases in PCWP, MABP, SVR, and heart rate and increases in CI and stroke volume index were observed after 10 weeks of treatment with fosinopril at 20 and 40 mg once daily (P < or = .05 v 1 mg group for PCWP and MABP at most time points and P < or = .05 v baseline for other parameters at most time points). Dose-related trends toward reduced supplemental diuretic use (P = .027) and reduced symptoms of dyspnea (P = .008) were observed with the 20-mg and 40-mg fosinopril dose groups. Once daily administration of fosinopril at 20 and 40 mg was safe and well tolerated, provided a sustained beneficial hemodynamic effect, improved left ventricular performance, and reduced symptoms of dyspnea, resulting in a reduced need for supplemental diuretic therapy.
11330342	Blocking effects of the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone on the HERG potassium channel.	Propafenone has been shown to affect the delayed-rectifier potassium currents in cardiomyocytes of different animal models. In this study we investigated effects and mechanisms of action of propafenone on HERG potassium channels in oocytes of Xenopus laevis with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Propafenone decreased the currents during voltage steps and the tail currents. The block was voltage-dependent and increased with positive going potentials (from 18% block of tail current amplitude at -40 mV to 69% at +40 mV with 100 micromol/l propafenone). The voltage dependence of block could be fitted with the sum of a monoexponential and a linear function. The fractional electrical distance was estimated to be delta=0.20. The block of current during the voltage step increased with time starting from a level of 83% of the control current. Propafenone accelerated the increase of current during the voltage step as well as the decay of tail currents (time constants of monoexponential fits decreased by 65% for the currents during the voltage step and by 37% for the tail currents with 100 micromol/l propafenone). The threshold concentration of propafenone effect was around 1 micromol/l and the concentration of half-maximal block (IC50) ranged between 13 micromol/l and 15 micromol/l for both current components. With high extracellular potassium concentrations, the IC50 value rose to 80 degrees mol/l. Acidification of the extracellular solution to pH 6.0 increased the IC50 value to 123 micromol/l, alkalization to pH 8.0 reduced it to 10 micromol/l and coexpression of the beta-subunit minK had no statistically significant effect on the concentration dependence. In conclusion, propafenone has been found to block HERG potassium channels. The data suggest that propafenone affects the channels in the open state and give some hints for an intracellular site of action.
11342206	Differential antiplatelet effects of various glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists.	The blockade of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) was recently introduced as a new antiplatelet strategy. At present, various GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors are available to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome or when undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. The current study systematically evaluates the antiplatelet effects of GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors in clinical use. Using conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies [ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS-1), PMI-1] and flow cytometry, we showed that the GPIIb-IIIa antagonists abciximab, integrelin, lamifiban, and tirofiban, but not EMD 122347 or YM 337, induced LIBS activity of platelet GPIIb-IIIa. The LIBS activity of GPIIb-IIIa antagonists correlates with a proaggregatory response of fixed platelets pretreated with GPIIb-IIIa antagonists (intrinsic activity). All tested GPIIb-IIIa antagonists completely inhibit concentration-dependent ADP (20 micromol/l)-induced aggregation. In contrast, substantial TRAP (25 micromol/l)-induced platelet aggregation still occurs even at high inhibitor concentrations of the tested GPIIb-IIIa antagonists. In addition, we show that GPIIb-IIIa antagonists are poor inhibitors of platelet release reaction (ATP and P-selectin secretion) especially when strong agonists such as TRAP are used to activate platelets. Inhibition of platelet procoagulant activity (thrombin generation) by GPIIb-IIIa antagonists is dependent on the type and concentration of antagonists and on the strength of stimulus (thrombin, tissue factor) used to induce platelet-dependent thrombin generation. The present data show that significant pharmacological differences exist between GPIIb-IIIa antagonists that may have consequences for antithrombotic strategies and for future drug development.
11343576	Dopaminergic drug response and the genotype (Taq IA polymorphism) of the dopamine D2 receptor.	The genotype of the receptor with which a particular drug interacts may be a between- subject factor that modifies the pharmacodynamic and consequently the therapeutic response to drugs. Subjects with A1 allele (Taq IA restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the gene encoding for the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) seem to express lower number of DRD2 compared to subjects who do not have this allele. We investigated whether subjects homozygous for the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene have decreased response to DRD2 stimulation by apomorphine when compared with those homozygous for the A2 allele. Two hundred and two Caucasian subjects were genotyped for DRD2 Taq IA polymorphism, 6.9 % had the genotype A1A1 and 65% A2A2. Nine homozygous subjects/group were selected for the apomorphine study. Five, 10 and 20 &mgr;g/kg of apomorphine were administered subcutaneously according to a randomized crossover design. The main pharmacodynamic criterion was the plasma growth hormone increase induced by apomorphine. Secondarily, we measured oral temperature responses and yawns in response to apomorphine. Plasma apomorphine concentrations were similar for the two matched and only genotypically different groups. Apomorphine dose-dependently increased serum growth hormone concentration, and significant effect of time, dose by time interaction but no effect of genotype or genotype by dose interaction was shown. Apomorphine decreased body temperature, significant effect of dose, time, dose by time interaction but no effect of genotype or genotype by dose interaction were observed. The number of apomorphine-induced yawns increased dose-dependently but no significant difference between groups occurred. Thus, in this study apomorphine-induced responses were not modified by DRD2 Taq IA polymorphism although the power of the study could be insufficient to detect subtle differences.
11350858	Short- and long-term influences of calcitonin gene-related peptide on the synthesis of acetylcholinesterase in mammalian myotubes.	The present study analyses the short- (15 min - 2 h) and long-term (24 - 48 h) influences of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression in the rat cultured skeletal muscle and the signal transduction events underlying CGRP actions. To assess the effect of CGRP on AChE synthesis, myotubes were pre-exposed to the irreversible AChE inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and treated with CGRP or forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator. Treatment of myotubes with 1 - 100 nM CGRP for 2 h increased by up to 42% the synthesis of catalytically active AChE with a parallel increase in the intracellular cyclic AMP. The stimulation of AChE synthesis induced by CGRP was mimicked by direct activation of AC with 3 - 30 microM forskolin. In contrast, pre-treatment of cultures with 100 nM CGRP for 20 h reduced by 37% the subsequent synthesis of AChE, resulting in a 15% decrease in total AChE activity after 48 h CGRP treatment. Moreover, 24 h treatment of myotubes with 100 nM CGRP reduced by 54% the accumulation of cyclic AMP induced by a subsequent CGRP treatment. These findings indicate that, in skeletal muscle cells, CGRP modulates the AChE expression in a time-dependent manner, initially stimulating the enzyme synthesis through a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism. The decreased AChE synthesis observed after long-term CGRP treatment suggests that CGRP signalling system is subject to desensitization or down-regulation, that might function as an important adaptative mechanism of the muscle fibre in response to long-term changes in neuromuscular transmission.
11352938	Synergism of Xist RNA, DNA methylation, and histone hypoacetylation in maintaining X chromosome inactivation.	Xist RNA expression, methylation of CpG islands, and hypoacetylation of histone H4 are distinguishing features of inactive X chromatin. Here, we show that these silencing mechanisms act synergistically to maintain the inactive state. Xist RNA has been shown to be essential for initiation of X inactivation, but not required for maintenance. We have developed a system in which the reactivation frequency of individual X-linked genes can be assessed quantitatively. Using a conditional mutant Xist allele, we provide direct evidence for that loss of Xist RNA destabilizes the inactive state in somatic cells, leading to an increased reactivation frequency of an X-linked GFP transgene and of the endogenous hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Demethylation of DNA, using 5-azadC or by introducing a mutation in Dnmt1, and inhibition of histone hypoacetylation using trichostatin A further increases reactivation in Xist mutant fibroblasts, indicating a synergistic interaction of X chromosome silencing mechanisms.
11352979	Secretion of hepatocyte apoB is inhibited by the flavonoids, naringenin and hesperetin, via reduced activity and expression of ACAT2 and MTP.	The citrus flavonoids, naringenin and hesperetin, lower plasma cholesterol in vivo. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The ability of these flavonoids to modulate apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion and cellular cholesterol homeostasis was determined in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. apoB accumulation in the media decreased in a dose-dependent manner following 24-h incubations with naringenin (up to 82%, P < 0.00001) or hesperetin (up to 74%, P < 0.002). Decreased apoB secretion was associated with reduced cellular cholesteryl ester mass. Cholesterol esterification was decreased, dose-dependently, up to 84% (P < 0.0001) at flavonoid concentrations of 200 microM. Neither flavonoid demonstrated selective inhibition of either form of acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) as determined using CHO cells stably transfected with either ACAT1 or ACAT2. However, in HepG2 cells, ACAT2 mRNA was selectively decreased (- 50%, P < 0.001) by both flavonoids, whereas ACAT1 mRNA was unaffected. In addition, naringenin and hesperetin decreased both the activity (- 20% to - 40%, P < 0.00004) and expression (- 30% to - 40%, P < 0.02) of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Both flavonoids caused a 5- to 7-fold increase (P < 0.02) in low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor mRNA, which resulted in a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in uptake and degradation of (125)I-LDL. We conclude that both naringenin and hesperetin decrease the availability of lipids for assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins, an effect mediated by 1) reduced activities of ACAT1 and ACAT2, 2) a selective decrease in ACAT2 expression, and 3) reduced MTP activity. Together with an enhanced expression of the LDL receptor, these mechanisms may explain the hypocholesterolemic properties of the citrus flavonoids.
11357996	Rapid, simple, and culture-independent detection of rpsL codon 43 mutations that are highly predictive of streptomycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	The substitution of codon 43 in the gene rpsL is the single most common mutation found in streptomycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The characterization of this mutation has been hampered by the need for prior cultivation of the mycobacteria, the need for DNA sequencing, or both. In this report we describe a simple and culture-independent technique to detect this mutation directly from sputum samples, requiring little more than a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine and a simple agarose minigel. There is no need for labeled probes or DNA sequencing. In a preliminary test of feasibility, interpretable results were obtained from all of 16 smear-positive and 1 of 4 smear-negative, culture-positive samples. Two of two samples containing M. tuberculosis with rpsL codon 43 mutations were correctly identified.
11377395	Testosterone-mediated modulation of HERG blockade by proarrhythmic agents.	Diverse drugs from many therapeutic classes exert cardiotoxic side effects by inducing torsades de pointes (TdP), a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia, which often results from drug interaction with HERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) encoded K(+) channels, that generate an I(Kr) component of the delayed rectifier cardiac K(+) current. Men are known to be at a lower risk for drug-induced TdP than women suggesting a role of sex steroid hormones, androgens and estrogens, in modulation of drug sensitivity of cardiac K(+) channels, particularly those encoded by HERG. Here by using neuroleptic agents haloperidol, pimozide, and fluspirilene, all of which can induce TdP, and a steroid hormone-sensitive system Xenopus oocytes for HERG channels expression we show that testosterone is able to reduce HERG-blocking potency of neuroleptics. Haloperidol, pimozide, and fluspirilene inhibited HERG current with IC(50) of 1.36, 1.74, and 2.34 microM, and maximal block of 73%, 76% and 65%, respectively. The action of these neuroleptics was voltage-dependent, most consistent with an open-channel blocking mechanism. Pretreatment of HERG-expressing oocytes with 1 microM testosterone increased the IC(50) values to 2.73, 2.08, and 5.04 microM, reduced the maximal block to 65%, 59%, and 64%, and strongly diminished voltage-dependence of the blockade. Testosterone treatment per se produced about a 35% reduction of HERG current compared with untreated oocytes. Our data suggest that androgens may protect against the arrhythmogenic actions of some cardiotoxic drugs.
11395483	The uptake inhibitors cocaine and benztropine differentially alter the conformation of the human dopamine transporter.	The binding affinity of the cocaine analog [(3)H]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (WIN) for the dopamine transporter (DAT) is increased by the reaction of Cys-90, at the extracellular end of the first transmembrane segment, with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. Cocaine enhances the reaction of Cys-90 with the sulfhydryl reagents, thereby augmenting the increase in binding. In contrast, cocaine decreases the reaction of Cys-135 and Cys-342, endogenous cysteines in cytoplasmic loops, with MTS reagents. Because this reaction inhibits [(3)H]WIN binding, cocaine protects against the loss of binding caused by reaction of these cysteines. In the present work, we compare the abilities of DAT inhibitors and substrates to affect the reaction of Cys-90, Cys-135, and Cys-342 with MTS ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET). The results indicate that the different abilities of compounds to protect against the MTSET-induced inhibition of binding are attributable to differences in their abilities to attenuate the inhibitory effects of modification of Cys-135 and Cys-342 as well as to enhance the reaction with Cys-90 and the resulting potentiation of binding. The inhibitor benztropine was unique in its inability to protect Cys-135. Moreover, whereas cocaine, WIN, mazindol, and dopamine enhanced the reaction of Cys-90 with MTSET, benztropine had no effect on this reaction. These two features combine to give benztropine its weak potency in protecting ligand binding to wild-type DAT from MTSET. These results indicate that different inhibitors of DAT, such as cocaine and benztropine, produce different conformational changes in the transporter. There are differences in the psychomotor stimulant-like effects of these compounds, and it is possible that the different behavioral effects of these DAT inhibitors stem from their different molecular actions on DAT.
11408092	Regional distribution of ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels in experimental cat brain tumors.	Biosynthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, and activation of the first key enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) are closely associated with cellular proliferation. In the present study, the distribution of ODC activity and polyamine levels was investigated for the first time regionally in experimental brain tumors of the cat. Brain tumors were produced by stereotactic xenotransplantation of rat glioma cells. Twenty days after implantation, the brains were frozen in situ, cut into slices, and cryostat sections and tissue samples were taken to determine ODC activity and polyamine levels biochemically. The quantified data were color-coded to present the regional distribution of ODC activity and polyamine levels in the respective section. ODC activity significantly increased in some areas within the tumor, whereas peritumoral tissue showed no difference to the non-tumoral, contralateral hemisphere. This increase turned out in parallel to a high number of mitoses in the same tumor parts (r=0.861). Putrescine levels increased both, in the whole tumor and in the peritumoral edema. Regional differences in putrescine content did not correlate with solid and proliferative parts of the tumor. Spermidine and spermine levels were only slightly increased in some parts of the tumor. Thus, these experiments show the close correlation of a high mitotic rate and activation of ODC within experimental gliomas and underline the relevance of ODC as a biochemical marker of proliferation in brain tumors.
11408526	AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan administered peripherally inhibits central responses to angiotensin II in conscious rats.	The effects of systemic treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan on central effects of angiotensin II (Ang II), namely, increase in blood pressure, vasopressin release into the circulation, and drinking response, were investigated in conscious, normotensive rats. The central responses to i.c.v. Ang II (30 ng/kg) were measured at 0.5, 2, 4, and 24 h following acute i.v. or acute and chronic oral telmisartan application. At a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v., the drinking response to i.c.v. Ang II was completely blocked over 4 h, while the pressor response and the release of vasopressin in response to i.c.v. Ang II were blocked by 60 to 80%. The inhibition of the centrally mediated pressor and drinking response to Ang II was sustained over 24 h. The lower doses of telmisartan (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced actions over 4 h. A consistent 24-h inhibition of the central responses to i.c.v. Ang II was obtained after acute and chronic oral treatment with 30 mg/kg telmisartan. Oral treatment with 1 and 3 mg/kg telmisartan produced a slight but inconsistent inhibition of the central actions of Ang II. Telmisartan concentrations measured in the cerebrospinal fluid following 8 days of consecutive daily oral treatment (1-30 mg/kg) ranged from 0.87 +/- 0.27 ng/ml (1 mg/kg/day) to 46.5 +/- 11.6 ng/ml (30 mg/kg/day). Our results demonstrate that, following peripheral administration, the AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan can penetrate the blood-brain barrier in a dose- and time-dependent manner to inhibit centrally mediated effects of Ang II.
11413269	Polyamine metabolism in brain tumours: diagnostic relevance of quantitative biochemistry.	Activation of polyamine metabolism is closely associated with cellular proliferation. The purpose was to investigate whether the content of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, and the activity of the first metabolic key enzyme of polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), represent biochemical markers of malignancy in brain tumours.
11426832	Characterization of organic anion transport inhibitors using cells stably expressing human organic anion transporters.	The organic anion transport system is involved in the tubular excretion of various clinically important drugs. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of various organic anion transport inhibitors on organic anion transport using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human organic anion transporter 1 (human-OAT1) and human-OAT3, which are localized to the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule. Organic anion transport inhibitors including betamipron, cilastatin, KW-3902 (8-(noradamantan-3-yl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine) and probenecid significantly inhibited human-OAT1- and human-OAT3-mediated organic anion uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analyses revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The Ki values of betamipron, cilastatin, KW-3902 and probencid for human-OAT1 were 23.6, 1470, 7.82 and 12.1 microM, whereas those for human-OAT3 were 48.3, 231, 3.70 and 9.0 microM. These results suggest that betamipron and probenecid could inhibit both human-OAT1- and human-OAT3-mediated organic anion transport in vivo, whereas cilastatin could inhibit only human-OAT3-mediated one. In contrast, KW-3902 did not exert the effects of significance, whereas KW-3902 was the most potent.
11443057	Contractile regulation of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter in vascular smooth muscle.	Vasoconstrictors activate the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1 in rat aortic smooth muscle, but the mechanism is unknown. Efflux of (86)Rb(+) from rat aorta in response to phenylephrine (PE) was measured in the absence and presence of bumetanide, a specific inhibitor of NKCC1. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) completely abolished the activation of NKCC1 by PE. This was not due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels since blocking these channels with Ba(2+) in Ca(2+)-replete solution did not prevent activation of NKCC1 by PE. Stimulation of NKCC1 by PE was inhibited 70% by 75 microM ML-9, 97% by 2 microM wortmannin, and 70% by 2 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime, each of which inhibited isometric force generation in aortic rings. Bumetanide-insensitive Rb(+) efflux, an indication of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channel activity, was reduced by ML-9 but not by the other inhibitors. Stretching of aortic rings on tubing to increase lumen diameter to 120% of normal almost completely blocked the stimulation of NKCC1 by PE without inhibiting the stimulation by hypertonic shrinkage. We conclude that activation of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter by PE is the direct result of smooth muscle contraction through Ca(2+)-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase. This indicates that the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter is regulated by the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle.
11444429	Dopamine D2 receptor gene expression in human adenohypophysial adenomas.	The inhibitory effects of dopamine on adenohypophysial cells are mediated via dopamine subtype 2 receptor (D2R). Dopamine agonists inhibit hormone release and induce tumor shrinkage in most prolactin-secreting adenomas, whereas in other adenoma types such effects are sporadic. We investigated D2R gene expression by in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunocytochemistry in different types of pituitary adenomas. By ISH, a variable D2R signal was detected in 79 of 89 cases: 4 of 6 densely granulated and 8 of 8 sparsely granulated somatotroph, 4 of 4 mammosomatotroph, 7 of 7 mixed somatotroph-lactotroph, 4 of 4 acidophil stem cell, 16 of 16 sparsely granulated lactotroph, 11 of 16 corticotroph (functioning and silent), 3 of 4 silent subtype 3, 5 of 5 thyrotroph, 5 of 6 gonadotroph, 5 of 6 null cell, and 7 of 7 oncocytic adenomas. By immunocytochemistry, D2R protein was localized in cytoplasm and nuclei of 60 of 62 adenomas. In lactotroph adenomas, long-acting bromocriptine (BEC-LAR) induced a major increase in D2R mRNA, which was not accompanied by increased D2R immunoreactivity, suggesting mRNA stabilization. In conclusion, D2R gene is expressed in the majority of pituitary adenomas representing all tumor types. The significance of nuclear localization of D2R protein remains to be clarified.
11444497	Effect of the AT1-receptor antagonists losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan on angiotensin II-induced facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission in the rat mesenteric artery.	The effect of the AT1-receptor antagonists losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced facilitation of noradrenergic neurotransmission was investigated in the isolated rat mesenteric artery under isometric conditions. Electrical field stimulation (2, 4, and 8 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent increase of contractile force. At stimulation frequencies of 2, 4, and 8 Hz, Ang 11 (10 nM) increased the stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses by a factor 4.8 +/- 0.9, 2.9 +/- 0.7, and 1.3 +/- 0.1, respectively (p < 0.05 compared with control for all frequencies). The enhancement could be concentration-dependently antagonized by losartan (1 nM-1 microM), irbesartan (0.1 nM-0.1 microM), and telmisartan (0.01 nM-0.01 microM). At a stimulation frequency of 2 Hz, the relation between stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses (in presence of Ang II 10 nM) and the concentration of the AT1-antagonists used could be described by linear regression. The order of potency concerning sympathoinhibition was telmisartan > irbesartan > losartan (p < 0.05 between linear regression lines). Contractile responses to exogenous noradrenaline were unaltered in the presence of Ang II 10 nM. We conclude that the facilitating effect of Ang II on noradrenergic neurotransmission is mediated by presynaptically located AT1-receptors. Conversely, this facilitating effect can be dose-dependently counteracted by blockade of these receptors. Sympathoinhibitory properties are likely to contribute to the therapeutic effect of AT1-blockers, in particular in conditions in which the sympathetic nervous system is activated, such as congestive heart failure and hypertension.
11448221	Design, synthesis, computational prediction, and biological evaluation of ester soft drugs as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase from Pneumocystis carinii.	A series of lipophilic soft drugs structurally related to the nonclassical dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors trimetrexate and piritrexim have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated in DHFR assays, with special emphasis on the inhibition of P. carinii DHFR. The best inhibitors, encompassing an ester bond in the bridge connecting the two aromatic systems, were approximately 10 times less potent than trimetrexate and piritrexim. The metabolites were designed to be poor inhibitors. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of three ligands in complex with DHFR from Pneumocystis carinii and from the human enzyme were conducted in order to better understand the factors determining the selectivity. A correct ranking of the relative inhibition of DHFR was achieved utilizing the linear interaction energy method. The soft drugs are intended for local administration. One representative ester was selected for a pharmacokinetic study in rats where it was found to undergo fast metabolic degradation to the predicted inactive metabolites.
11455015	G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels are targets for volatile anesthetics.	G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) are a family of homo- and hetero-oligomeric K(+) channels composed of different subunits (GIRK1 to 4 in mammals). GIRK4 and GIRK1 are found mainly in the atrium, whereas neuronal cells predominantly express the GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK3 isoforms. When activated, GIRK channels slow the firing rate of atrial myocytes and neuronal cells. Because of their key role in controlling excitability, we investigated the influence of a prototypic anesthetic, halothane, on GIRK channels of different subunit composition expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Halothane enhanced background currents through hetero-oligomeric GIRK1/GIRK4 and homo-oligomeric GIRK1(F137S) channels but not through homo-oligomeric GIRK2 channels. This activation of basal current did not depend on the presence of coexpressed G protein-coupled receptors but instead required the presence of G(beta/gamma). In contrast to basal GIRK currents, the agonist-induced GIRK current (via coexpressed m2 muscarinic receptors) was inhibited by halothane. For GIRK1/GIRK4 and GIRK1(F137S) channels this inhibition was most pronounced at low concentrations of the anesthetic (0.1-0.3 mM) and occurred also when channels had been activated by guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate. This inhibition, however, was overridden by high concentrations of halothane (0.9 mM) and augmentation of the agonist-induced current was observed. This increase in agonist-induced current was never seen with GIRK2 homo-oligomeric channels. Agonist-induced currents mediated by GIRK2 channels were always inhibited by halothane with an IC(50) value of approximately 60 microM. These data suggest a direct interaction of halothane with GIRK channels.
11463765	Association of sodium channel gamma-subunit promoter variant with blood pressure.	The SCNN1G gene, located on human chromosome 16p12, encodes the gamma subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel, and mutations in SCNN1G can result in Liddle's syndrome or pseudohypoaldosteronism type I. We identified sequence variations in the promoter region of SCNN1G and examined the association between this polymorphism and blood pressure in a large cohort (n=4075) representing the general population in Japan. We found T(-1290)C, T(-501)G, G(-173)A, and G(-104)T polymorphisms in the promoter region of SCNN1G and confirmed the existence of T387C and T474C polymorphisms in exon 3 and the C1947G polymorphism in exon 13. Because the genotypes of the T(-1290)C, T(-501)G, G(-104)T, and T474C polymorphisms were in tight linkage disequilibrium, we selected the T474C and G(-173)A polymorphisms for an association study. The G(-173)A polymorphism of SCNN1G had a significant effect on systolic pressure (P=0.0050) and pulse pressure (P=0.0050). The AA genotype was associated with an 11 mm Hg drop in systolic pressure and an 8 mm Hg drop in pulse pressure and with a higher prevalence of hypotension (P=0.0195). A transient transfection assay using MDCK cells and human renal epithelial cells indicated that the promoter activity of the G(-173) allele was higher than that of the A(-173) allele. Although the effects of the A(-173) allele were recessive and although the AA genotype was found in just 0.7% of our study population, we observed that this variation of human SCNN1G had significant effects on blood pressure.
11477109	Structure of eicosapentaenoic and linoleic acids in the cyclooxygenase site of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1.	Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2 (PGHSs) can oxygenate 18-22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, albeit with varying efficiencies. Here we report the crystal structures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6) bound in the cyclooxygenase active site of Co(3+) protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted ovine PGHS-1 (Co(3+)-oPGHS-1) and compare the effects of active site substitutions on the rates of oxygenation of EPA, LA, and arachidonic acid (AA). Both EPA and LA bind in the active site with orientations similar to those seen previously with AA and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA). For EPA, the presence of an additional double bond (C-17/C-18) causes this substrate to bind in a "strained" conformation in which C-13 is misaligned with respect to Tyr-385, the residue that abstracts hydrogen from substrate fatty acids. Presumably, this misalignment is responsible for the low rate of EPA oxygenation. For LA, the carboxyl half binds in a more extended configuration than AA, which results in positioning C-11 next to Tyr-385. Val-349 and Ser-530, recently identified as important determinants for efficient oxygenation of DHLA by PGHS-1, play similar roles in the oxygenation of EPA and LA. Approximately 750- and 175-fold reductions in the oxygenation efficiency of EPA and LA were observed with V349A oPGHS-1, compared with a 2-fold change for AA. Val-349 contacts C-2 and C-3 of EPA and C-4 of LA orienting the carboxyl halves of these substrates so that the omega-ends are aligned properly for hydrogen abstraction. An S530T substitution decreases the V(max)/K(m) of EPA and LA by 375- and 140-fold. Ser-530 makes six contacts with EPA and four with LA involving C-8 through C-16; these interactions influence the alignment of the substrate for hydrogen abstraction. Interestingly, replacement of Phe-205 increases the volume of the cyclooxygenase site allowing EPA to be oxygenated more efficiently than with native oPGHS-1.
11486244	Angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan decreases lesion size, chemokine expression, and macrophage accumulation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.	Recent data suggest that angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of atherosclerosis. To clarify how AT1 receptor antagonists reduce atherosclerosis, the effect of irbesartan on atherosclerotic lesion development was determined in low-fat, chow-fed apolipoprotein (Apo) E-deficient mice. Irbesartan (50 mg/kg per day) strongly decreased lesion development after a 12-week treatment period (lesion size: irbesartan treated, 20,524 +/- 4,200 microm(2) vs. control, 99,600 +/- 14,500; 79.4% inhibition, p < 0.001). This effect was not due to an effect of irbesartan on lipoprotein levels because irbesartan slightly increased total cholesterol levels and decreased the ratio of Apo A-I relative to Apo B levels. Immunochemical analysis of the atherosclerotic lesions using the mac3 monoclonal antibody showed the presence of macrophages in the lesions of control mice, whereas sections from irbesartan-treated animals only showed occasional labeling in the lesion area. These data suggest that irbesartan inhibits monocyte/macrophage influx into the vessel wall. Therefore, expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as other chemokines involved in macrophage infiltration into the lesion area, were measured in the aortic sinus of control and irbesartan-treated animals. Irbesartan treatment strongly decreased MCP-1 mRNA levels as well as MCP-1 immunostaining in the lesion area. This effect of irbesartan on MCP-1 occurred without an effect on CCR2, the receptor of MCP-1. Expression of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, another CC chemokine expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, was also reduced after irbesartan treatment, without effect on CCR3 and CCR5, the receptors of MIP-1alpha. Concomitantly, the expression of the angiogenic chemokines KC and MIP-2, which are functionally related to interleukin-8, were downregulated, whereas their shared receptor CXCR2 was upregulated. These data suggest that inhibition of the inflammatory component of lesion progression plays an important role in the inhibitory effect of AT1 receptor antagonists on atherosclerotic lesion formation.
11500505	Mutation of Trp1254 in the multispecific organic anion transporter, multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) (ABCC2), alters substrate specificity and results in loss of methotrexate transport activity.	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins comprise a large superfamily of transmembrane transporters that utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate their substrates across biological membranes. Multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 (ABCC2) belongs to subfamily C of the ABC superfamily and, when overexpressed in tumor cells, confers resistance to a wide variety of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. MRP2 is also an active transporter of organic anions such as methotrexate (MTX), estradiol glucuronide (E217betaG), and leukotriene C4 and is located on the apical membrane of polarized cells including hepatocytes where it acts as a biliary transporter. We recently identified a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the related MRP1 that is critical for the substrate specificity of this protein. In the present study, we have examined the effect of replacing the analogous tryptophan residue at position 1254 of MRP2. We found that only nonconservative substitutions (Ala and Cys) of Trp1254 eliminated [3H]E217betaG transport by MRP2, whereas more conservative substitutions (Phe and Tyr) had no effect. In addition, only the most conservatively substituted mutant (W1254Y) transported [3H]leukotriene C4, whereas all other substitutions eliminated transport of this substrate. On the other hand, all substitutions of Trp1254 eliminated transport of [3H]MTX. Finally, we found that sulfinpyrazone stimulated [3H]E217betaG transport by wild-type MRP2 4-fold, whereas transport by the Trp1254 substituted mutants was enhanced 6-10-fold. In contrast, sulfinpyrazone failed to stimulate [3H]MTX transport by either wild-type MRP2 or the MRP2-Trp1254 mutants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Trp1254 plays an important role in the ability of MRP2 to transport conjugated organic anions and identify this amino acid in the putative last transmembrane segment (TM17) of this ABC protein as being critical for transport of MTX.
11502876	A Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent transporter for catecholamines, identified as a norepinephrine transporter, is expressed in the brain of the teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes).	We report the isolation, functional characterization, and localization of a Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent catecholamine transporter (meNET) present in the brain of the teleost fish medaka. This carrier is very similar to the human neuronal norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the human neuronal dopamine transporter (DAT), showing 70 and 64% amino acid identity, respectively. When expressed in COS-7 cells, this transporter mediates the high-affinity uptake of dopamine (K(M) = 290 nM) and norepinephrine (K(M) = 640 nM). Its pharmacological profile reveals more similarities with NET, including a high affinity for the tricyclic antidepressants desipramine (IC(50) = 0.92 nM) and nortriptyline (IC(50) = 16 nM). In situ hybridization on the medaka brain shows that meNET mRNA is present only in a subset of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons found in the noradrenergic areas of the hindbrain, such as the locus ceruleus and area postrema. None of the dopaminergic areas anterior to the isthmus contains any labeled neurons. Neither reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers specific for gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter/NET nor autoradiographic experiments with [(125)I]3b-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane-2b-carboxylic acid methyl ester revealed an additional catecholamine transporter in the medaka brain. Uptake experiments with medaka brain synaptosomes show an endogenous transport with a pharmacological profile identical to that of the recombinant meNET. Thus, meNET is probably the predominant--if not the only--catecholamine transporter in the medaka fish brain. In view of the highly conserved primary structures and pharmacological properties of meNET, it is tempting to speculate that a specific dopamine transport developed later in vertebrate evolution and probably accompanied the tremendous enlargement of the meso-telencephalic dopaminergic pathways in amniotes.
11519881	Effect of a pharmacological activation of PPAR on the expression of RAR and TR in rat liver.	It has recently been shown that high-fat diets induce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) with a concomitant decrease in expression of retinoic acid (RAR) and triiodothyronine (TR) receptors in rat liver. The authors have suggested that PPAR activation may be responsible for these modifications in nuclear receptor expression. With the aim of gaining further insight into a possible relationship between the patterns of expression of these receptors, we have examined, using a pharmacological model, the effect of a strong and specific PPAR activation induced by bezafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator agent. Activation of PPAR was evaluated by quantifying PPAR alpha mRNA and acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA. The expression of RAR and TR was determined by assaying the binding properties of these nuclear receptors and by quantifying the mRNA level of RAR beta and TR alpha1,beta1 isoforms. After a 10 day treatment of young rats, induction of PPAR (PPAR alpha mRNA was increased by 40% [P< 0.05 and acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA by 411% [P<0.001]) and a concomitant decrease of RAR and TR expression (Maximal Binding Capacity was decreased by 21 and 26%, respectively [P<0.05]) in the liver was observed. RXR alpha mRNA expression was unchanged by treatment. Cross-talk between RAR, TR and PPAR signalling pathways may be implicated in the new patterns of nuclear receptor expression observed. The decreased expression of RAR and TR reported here could provide a novel element for the understanding of the link between PPAR and tumorigenesis in rat liver.
11524006	Regulation of human cystathionine beta-synthase by S-adenosyl-L-methionine: evidence for two catalytically active conformations involving an autoinhibitory domain in the C-terminal region.	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), condensing homocysteine and serine, represents a key regulatory point in the biosynthesis of cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. Inherited deficiency of CBS causes homocystinuria. CBS is activated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) by inducing a conformational change involving a noncatalytic C-terminal region spanning residues 414-551. We report the purification of two patient-derived C-terminal mutant forms of CBS, S466L and I435T, that provide new insight into the mechanism of CBS regulation and indicate a regulatory function for the "CBS domain". Both of these point mutations confer catalytically active proteins. The I435T protein is AdoMet inducible but is 10-fold less responsive than wild-type (WT) CBS to physiologically relevant concentrations of this compound. The S466L form does not respond to AdoMet but is constitutively activated to a level intermediate between those of WT CBS in the presence and absence of AdoMet. Both mutant proteins are able to bind AdoMet, indicating that their impairment is related to their ability to assume the fully activated conformation that AdoMet induces in WT CBS. We found that I435T and WT CBS can be activated by partial thermal denaturation but that the AdoMet-stimulated WT, S466L, and a truncated form of CBS lacking the C-terminal region cannot be further activated by this treatment. Tryptophan and PLP fluorescence data for these different forms of CBS indicate that activation by AdoMet, limited proteolysis, and thermal denaturation share a common mechanism involving the displacement of an autoinhibitory domain located in the C-terminal region of the protein.
11524243	p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase but not p44/p42 MAP kinase is involved in prostaglandin E1-induced vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis in osteoblasts.	We investigated the mechanism underlying vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis stimulated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. PGE1 induced the phosphorylation of both p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and p38 MAP kinase. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, inhibited the PGE1-stimulated VEGF synthesis as well as PGE1-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. PD98059, an inhibitor of the upstream kinase that activates p44/p42 MAP kinase, which reduced the PGE1-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase, had little effect on the VEGF synthesis stimulated by PGE1. AH-6809, an antagonist of the subtypes of the PGE receptor, EP1 and EP2, or SC-19220, an antagonist of EP1 receptor, did not inhibit the PGE1-induced VEGF synthesis. H-89, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and SQ22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, reduced the VEGF synthesis induced by PGE1. Cholera toxin, an activator of G(s), and forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, induced VEGF synthesis. SB203580 and PD169316, another specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, reduced the cholera toxin-, forskolin- or 8bromo-cAMP-stimulated VEGF synthesis. However, PD98059 failed to affect the VEGF synthesis stimulated by cholera toxin, forskolin or 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8bromo-cAMP). SB203580 reduced the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase induced by forskolin or 8bromo-cAMP. These results strongly suggest that p44/p42 MAP kinase activation is not involved in the PGE1-stimulated VEGF synthesis in osteoblasts but that p38 MAP kinase activation is involved.
11529688	Anti-inflammatory activities of LDP-392, a dual PAF receptor antagonist and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.	Leukotrienes (LTs) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) are important mediators of inflammation and allergy. LDP-392, a novel dual PAF receptor antagonist and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor, has been identified. LDP-392 is 17.9-fold more potent than zileuton (5-LO inhibitor) in the RBL cytosolic 5-LO assay, and equally potent as MK 287 (PAF receptor antagonist) in the human platelet PAF receptor binding assay. The in vivo dual activities of LDP-392 were confirmed by measuring the inhibition of ex vivo LTB(4)production in rats and PAF-induced hemoconcentration in mice. Intravenous administration of LDP-392 demonstrated greater inhibition than zileuton, BN 50739 or MK 287 on arachidonic acid-induced ear edema and protected mice from LPS-induced lethality. Topical administration of LDP-392, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited TPA-induced ear edema in mice and UVB-induced erythema in guinea-pigs. These data suggest that LDP-392, as a dual PAF receptor antagonist and 5-LO inhibitor, may be of greater clinical effectiveness.
11535580	Gating-dependent mechanisms for flecainide action in SCN5A-linked arrhythmia syndromes.	Mutations in the cardiac sodium (Na) channel gene (SCN5A) give rise to the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT3) and the Brugada syndrome. Na channel blockade by antiarrhythmic drugs improves the QT interval prolongation in LQT3 but worsens the Brugada syndrome ST-segment elevation. Although Na channel blockade has been proposed as a treatment for LQT3, flecainide also evokes "Brugada-like" ST-segment elevation in LQT3 patients. Here, we examine how Na channel inactivation gating defects in LQT3 and Brugada syndrome elicit proarrhythmic sensitivity to flecainide.
11561080	Peroxynitrite-induced nitrotyrosination of proteins is blocked by direct 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton.	We have previously shown that the ability of overnight pretreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to suppress alveolar macrophage (AM) leukotrienes (LT) synthesis is explained by induction of nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). More recently we have demonstrated that the generation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) from the combination of NO and ROI directly nitrotyrosinates the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzyme and reduces cell-free and intact AM 5-LO metabolism. This effect of ONOO- was associated with nitrotyrosination of the 5-LO enzyme in intact cells and after treatment of recombinant enzyme. We postulated that LPS treatment of cells resulted in activation of 5-LO with the generation of ROI, which in turn led to autoinactivation of the enzyme. In an effort to suppress ROI generated from activation of 5-LO we examined the effect of a direct 5-LO inhibitor on LPS-induced suppression of LT synthesis. Coincubation with the reversible 5-LO inhibitor zileuton during the LPS pretreatment of intact cells dose dependently blocked the inhibition of 5-LO metabolism by LPS. The effect of zileuton on LPS-induced suppression of LT synthesis was similar to that of N-monomethyl-L-arginine. Zileuton had no effect on inducible nitric-oxide synthase induction. Interestingly, zileuton blocked ONOO--induced nitrotyrosination of recombinant 5-LO in a cell-free system as well as of native enzyme in intact cells. Moreover, zileuton blocked the nitrotyrosination of other proteins. We conclude that the suppression of 5-LO activity occurring with LPS treatment can be blocked by zileuton. The mechanism by which zileuton is effective is in part explained by blocking nitrotyrosination of 5-LO.
11563332	Recognition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) active site by NSAIDs: a computer modelling study.	The energetics and models of COX-2 complexed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) having different degrees of selectivity for two isoforms of COX (COX-2 and COX-1) have been studied using computer modelling approach. The models are obtained for complexes of NS398 (NS), a selective COX-2 inhibitor; indoprofen (Ind), a non-selective inhibitor; di-tert-butylbenzofurans (DHDMBFs) with substituents at the 5th position: CONH(CH2)2OMe (BF1), CONH-c-Pr (BF2), 3-methylene-gamma-butyrolactonyl (BF3) and oxicams namely, meloxicam (Mel), piroxicam (Pir) and tenoxicam (Ten). These were optimized using molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques. The binding energies and structures were compared with pharmacological parameters and available results with COX-1. In case of NS a larger difference in the binding energies between COX-2 and COX-1 was noticed as compared to that of Ind. It also had stronger interaction with His90 and Tyr355 which is considered important for COX-2 selectivity. There was a difference in the compactness at the channel entrance between COX-2 selective and non-selective ligands. Models with DHDMBFs and oxicams showed a similar correlation. The results were used to design a peptide inhibitor, Tyr-Arg-Cys-Ala-delta Phe-Cys (Pept) which could fit better in the COX-2 cavity. As per our MD simulation results this peptide inhibitor showed both higher activity and COX-2 selectivity.
11569611	Possible involvement of calcium-calmodulin pathways in the positive chronotropic response to angiotensin II on the canine cardiac sympathetic ganglia.	We investigated the ganglionic effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the signal transduction involved in the cardiac sympathetic ganglia by the direct administration of agents to the ganglia through the right subclavian artery and monitoring the heart rate as an indicator of the ganglionic function in pithed dogs. Ang II given i.a. caused increases in the heart rate, which was inhibited by the treatment with the AT1-receptor antagonist forasartan, but not by the AT2-receptor antagonist PD-123319. The stimulation by Ang II, but not by acetylcholine, was inhibited after treatment with an inhibitor of phospholipase C, U-73122; a cell-permeant modulator of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; an intracellular calcium and calcium-associated protein kinase inhibitor, HA-1077; calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor, W-7; Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor, KN-93; a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C; and Na+H+ exchange inhibitor, dimethylamiloride. These results suggest that Ang II stimulates the ganglionic transmission at postsynaptic sites via the activation of AT1 receptor coupled to either activation of phospholipase C, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+/CaM kinase II, although this ganglionic stimulation seems to involve, at least in part, the protein kinases-dependent increase of amiloride-sensitive Na+ inflow.
11570967	Cloning of rat interleukin 11 and interleukin 11 receptor alpha chain and analysis of their expression in rat uterus in the peri-implantation period.	Studies in mice have shown that interleukin 11 (IL-11) signalling is required for female fertility. In the absence of IL-11, decidualization is markedly retarded and implantation fails. IL-11 acts via a heterodimeric receptor composed of a ligand-specific receptor alpha chain (IL-11R alpha) and the signalling moiety gp130. This study reports the cloning of genes encoding rat IL-11 and IL-11R alpha. RNase protection was used to demonstrate that expression of IL-11 is upregulated in the rat uterus at the initiation of implantation at 5.5 days after mating. Expression of the genes encoding the two receptor components, IL11Ra and gp130, did not change throughout the peri-implantation period. In situ hybridization studies revealed that, as in mice, expression of IL-11 was high in the primary decidual zone at the time of the attachment reaction, whereas IL11Ra was expressed throughout primary and secondary decidua. Conservation of the temporal and spatial expression of IL-11 and IL-11R alpha in the uterus of the mouse and rat during the peri-implantation period will facilitate future studies investigating the role of IL-11 in fertility.
11588175	Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit both the activity and the inflammation-induced expression of acid-sensing ion channels in nociceptors.	Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are major drugs against inflammation and pain. They are well known inhibitors of cyclooxygenases (COXs). However, many studies indicate that they may also act on other targets. Acidosis is observed in inflammatory conditions such as chronic joint inflammation, in tumors and after ischemia, and greatly contributes to pain and hyperalgesia. Administration of NSAIDs reduces low-pH-induced pain. The acid sensitivity of nociceptors is associated with activation of H(+)-gated ion channels. Several of these, cloned recently, correspond to the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and others to the vanilloid receptor family. This paper shows (1) that ASIC mRNAs are present in many small sensory neurons along with substance P and isolectin B4 and that, in case of inflammation, ASIC1a appears in some larger Abeta fibers, (2) that NSAIDs prevent the large increase of ASIC expression in sensory neurons induced by inflammation, and (3) that NSAIDs such as aspirin, diclofenac, and flurbiprofen directly inhibit ASIC currents on sensory neurons and when cloned ASICs are heterologously expressed. These results suggest that the combined capacity to block COXs and inhibit both inflammation-induced expression and activity of ASICs present in nociceptors is an important factor in the action of NSAIDs against pain.
11588534	Eptifibatide and abciximab exhibit equivalent antiplatelet efficacy in an experimental model of stenting in both healthy volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease.	Platelet deposition and aggregation are the major determinants of acute thrombosis in coronary stents. We aimed to compare the antiplatelet efficacy of different treatments--glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa inhibitors and conventional antiaggregants--in an experimental model for stenting. Blood samples were obtained from patients with coronary artery disease (n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 8) and incubated either with eptifibatide (2.0 microg/ml), abciximab (3.0 microg/ml), indomethacin (15 microg/ml), or saline. Platelet adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation in whole blood was assessed for all groups. Blood was also tested in an experimental circulation model containing metallic probes, on which platelet deposition in shear flow conditions was assessed by means of fluorescent-labeled platelet-specific (anti-GpIIIa and Ib) antibodies. Eptifibatide and abciximab, in comparison with indomethacin and no treatment, significantly reduced platelet aggregation (0, 0, 4, and 3 arbitrary units [AU], respectively; p < 0.001), anti-GpIIIa (2.25, 1.83, 11.24, and 13.42 counts per second [cps]/mg, respectively; p < 0.001), and anti-GpIb binding (0.61, 0.61, 1.00, and 1.83 cps/mg, respectively; p < 0.001). Anti-GpIIIa and anti-GpIb binding were significantly correlated (R = 0.36; p < 0.01). Patients showed a higher anti-GpIIIa, but not anti-GpIb binding, than controls (8.43 versus 3.33 cps/mg; p < 0.01), irrespective of treatment. In conclusion, eptifibatide and abciximab show equivalent in vitro antiplatelet efficacy, superior to that of indomethacin. Given the occurrence of GpIIb/IIIa platelet overexpression in the course of coronary artery disease, an extended use of GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be proposed to prevent acute thrombosis during routine coronary stenting.
11594437	Zolmitriptan--a 5-HT1B/D agonist, alcohol, and aggression in mice.	Zolmitriptan is an anti-migraine agent with action at 5-HT1B/D receptors. It penetrates into the central nervous system and, like other 5-HT1B/D agonists, its pharmacotherapeutic profile may include significant anti-aggressive effects.
11594443	Sertindole is a serotonin 5-HT2c inverse agonist and decreases agonist but not antagonist binding to 5-HT2c receptors after chronic treatment.	Sertindole is a novel antipsychotic drug with high affinity for dopamine D2, alpha-1-adrenoceptors and serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2c receptors. The 5-HT2c receptor component of sertindole may be clinically relevant as this receptor subtype is implicated in regulation of anxiety, cognition/memory and brain plasticity.
11642004	Safety profile of almotriptan, a new antimigraine agent. Effects on central nervous system, renal function and respiratory dynamics.	Almotriptan (3-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]-5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonylmethyl)-1H-indole, CAS 154323-57-6) is a new 5-HT1B/1D agonist whose clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of almotriptan with respect to the central nervous system, renal function and respiratory dynamics using preclinical animal models. The results indicate that almotriptan does not cross the blood-brain barrier, since no effects on/interaction with spontaneous locomotor activity, hexobarbital-induced sleeping time, caffeine-induced increase of spontaneous locomotor activity, or hypothermia (caused by stimulation of central 5-HT1D receptors) was observed following treatment. Almotriptan had a mild antiemetic effect and a slight, transient diuretic effect in dogs, although the latter effect is probably of no clinical relevance. In addition, no effect on the respiratory system of conscious guinea pigs was observed following almotriptan treatment. These results indicate that almotriptan has a favourable safety profile with respect to the central nervous, renal and respiratory systems.
11669456	Characterization of ochratoxin A transport by human organic anion transporters.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of ochratoxin A (OTA) transport by multispecific human organic anion transporters (hOAT1 and hOAT3, respectively) using the second segment of proximal tubule (S2) cells from mice stably expressing hOAT1 and hOAT3 (S2 hOAT1 and S2 hOAT3). S2 hOAT1 and S2 hOAT3 exhibited a time- and dose-dependent, and a saturable increase in uptake of [3H]-OTA, with apparent Km values of 0.42 microM (hOAT1) and 0.75 microM (hOAT3). These OTA uptakes were inhibited by several substrates for the OATs. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), probenecid, piroxicam, octanoate and citrinin inhibited [3H]-OTA uptake by hOAT1 and hOAT3 in a competitive manner (Ki = 4.29-3080 microM), with the following order of potency: probenecid > octanoate > PAH > piroxicam > citrinin for hOAT1; probenecid > piroxicam > octanoate> citrinin > PAH for hOAT3. These results indicate that hOAT1, as well as hOAT3, mediates a high-affinity transport of OTA on the basolateral side of the proximal tubule, but hOAT1- and hOAT3-mediated OTA transport are differently influenced by the substrates for the OATs. These pharmacological characteristics of hOAT1 and hOAT3 may be significantly related with the events in the development of OTA-induced nephrotoxicity in the human kidney.
11669467	Inhibition of cyclic GMP hydrolysis in human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells by vardenafil, a novel, selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor.	One of the key mediators of penile erectile function is nitric oxide (NO), which activates soluble guanylyl cyclase within the smooth muscle of erectile tissue and stimulates the production of cGMP. In addition to synthesis by cyclases, intracellular cGMP concentrations are tightly regulated by phosphodiesterases, which hydrolyze and inactivate cyclic nucleotides. In this study, we compared the inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis by vardenafil and sildenafil; two inhibitors selective for phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Vardenafil is a novel, high affinity PDE5 inhibitor currently under clinical development. In soluble extracts of human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells, vardenafil and sildenafil effectively inhibited cGMP hydrolysis at substrate concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 microM cGMP. The IC50 values for vardenafil were approximately 5-fold lower than for sildenafil at the substrate concentrations tested. Dixon plot analyses of the inhibition data demonstrated that vardenafil had a smaller inhibition constant (Ki = 4.5 nM) than sildenafil (Ki = 14.7 nM) in the same cellular extracts. In intact cells, 10 microM of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside resulted in a minimal (17%) increase in cGMP, relative to basal levels (321 +/- 65 fmol/mg prot). Treatment of cells with 10, 50 or 100 nM vardenafil, in the presence of 10 microM sodium nitroprusside, elevated cGMP levels in a dose dependent fashion, from 63% to 137% of basal levels. Equimolar concentrations of sildenafil also caused dose dependent increases in intracellular cGMP, but to a lesser extent (27-60%). These observations suggest that vardenafil is a more potent PDE5 inhibitor, than sildenafil in vitro. The more pronounced increase of cGMP in the presence of NO in intact cells suggests that vardenafil will be effective at lower doses than sildenafil under clinical conditions.
11689132	Development and evaluation of high throughput functional assay methods for HERG potassium channel.	Three functional hERG channel assay methods have been developed and evaluated. The methods were tested against five known hERG channel inhibitors: dofetilide, terfenadine (Seldane), sertindole (Serdolect), astemizole (Hismanal), and cisapride (Propulsid). The DiBAC4(3)-based assays were found to be the most economical but had high false-hit rates as a result of the interaction of dye with the test compounds. The membrane potential dye assay had fewer color-quenching problems but was expensive and still gave false hits. The nonradioactive Rb+ efflux assay was the most sensitive of all the assays evaluated and had the lowest false-hit rate.
11697552	Rectal antinociceptive properties of alverine citrate are linked to antagonism at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype.	Serotonin (5-HT) is considered as a major mediator causing hyperalgesia and is involved in inflammatory reactions and irritable bowel syndrome. Alverine citrate may possess visceral antinociceptive properties in a rat model of rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions. This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological properties of alverine citrate in a rat model of rectal hyperalgesia induced by 5-HTP (5-HT precursor) and by a selective 5-HT1A agonist (8-OH-DPAT) and to compare this activity with a reference 5-HT1A antagonist (WAY 100635). At 4 h after their administration, 5-HTP and 8-OH-DPAT increased the number of abdominal contractions in response to rectal distension at the lowest volume of distension (0.4 mL). When injected intraperitoneally before 8-OH-DPAT and 5-HTP, WAY 100635 (1 mg kg(-1)) blocked their nociceptive effect, but also reduced the response to the highest volume of distension (1.6 mL). Similarly, when injected intraperitoneally, alverine citrate (20 mg kg(-1)) suppressed the effect of 5-HTP, but not that of 8-OH-DPAT. However, when injected intracerebroventricularly (75 microg/rat) alverine citrate reduced 8-OH-DPAT-induced enhancement of rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions. In-vitro binding studies revealed that alverine citrate had a high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors and a weak affinity for 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtypes. These results suggest that 5-HTP-induced rectal hypersensitivity involves 5-TH1A receptors and that alverine citrate acts as a selective antagonist at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype to block both 5-HTP and 8-OH-DPAT-induced rectal hypersensitivity.
11698253	Growth factors stimulate the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 through a novel Cl(-)-dependent mechanism.	The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 is an important volume-regulatory transporter that is regulated by cell volume and intracellular Cl(-). This regulation appears to be mediated by phosphorylation of NKCC1, although there is evidence for additional, cytoskeletal regulation via myosin light chain (MLC) kinase. NKCC1 is also activated by growth factors and may contribute to cell hypertrophy, but the mechanism is unknown. In aortic endothelial cells, NKCC1 (measured as bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb(+) influx) was rapidly stimulated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, and fibroblast growth factor, with the greatest stimulation by serum. Serum increased bumetanide-sensitive influx significantly more than bumetanide-sensitive efflux (131% vs. 44%), indicating asymmetric stimulation of NKCC1, and produced a 17% increase in cell volume and a 25% increase in Cl(-) content over 15 min. Stimulation by serum and hypertonic shrinkage were additive, and serum did not increase phosphorylation of NKCC1 or MLC, and did not decrease cellular Cl(-) content. When cellular Cl(-) was replaced with methanesulfonate, influx via NKCC1 increased and was no longer stimulated by serum, whereas stimulation by hypertonic shrinkage still occurred. Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism whereby serum activates NKCC1 by reducing its sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular Cl(-). This resetting of the Cl(-) set point of the transporter enables the cotransporter to produce a hypertrophic volume increase.
11719704	Dopamine transporter binding in the rat striatum is increased by gestational, perinatal, and adolescent exposure to heptachlor.	Heptachlor is a persistent cyclodiene pesticide that affects GABAergic function. Recent reports indicate that heptachlor exposure also alters dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and function in adult mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether gestational, perinatal, and/or adolescent heptachlor exposure in rats altered dopamine-receptor and DAT binding. Adolescent exposure to dieldrin was included to evaluate the generality of the findings. Sprague-Dawley rats received doses (po) ranging from 0 to 8.4 mg/kg/day of heptachlor, or dieldrin, 3 mg/kg/day, during different developmental periods. There were dose-related decreases in maternal weight gain and pup survival, as well as delayed righting reflex, at heptachlor doses > or =3 mg/kg/day. There were no changes in striatal dopamine receptor-D1 ([(3)H]SCH-23390) and -D2 ([(3)H]spiperone) binding in preweanling pups exposed perinatally to heptachlor, and no differences in the response of adult rats to the motor activity-increasing effects of d-amphetamine. However, there were significant (27-64%) increases in striatal DAT binding of [(3)H]mazindol in preweanling rats exposed only gestationally. In rats exposed perinatally and/or during adolescence, there were also increases (34-65%) in striatal DAT binding at postnatal days (PND) 22, 43, and 128. Adolescent exposure to dieldrin also increased DAT binding. In other rats exposed perinatally and throughout adolescence, even the lowest dose of heptachlor 0.3 mg/kg/d increased DAT binding on PND 130. The DAT affinity for mazindol was unchanged in heptachlor-exposed striata. In vitro binding studies indicated that heptachlor (> or =10 microM) displaced mazindol binding. Thus, gestational, perinatal, and/or adolescent exposure to heptachlor produced an increase in DAT binding as early as PND 10, and this change persisted into adulthood.
11723241	Molecular determinants of inactivation and dofetilide block in ether a-go-go (EAG) channels and EAG-related K(+) channels.	The major subunit of the cardiac delayed rectifier current I(Kr) is encoded by the human ether a-go-go related gene (HERG). HERG/I(Kr) channels are blocked selectively by class III antiarrhythmic methanesulfonanilide drugs such as dofetilide. The binding site for methanesulfonanilides is believed to be similar for nonantiarrhythmic drugs such as antihistamines, antibiotics, and antipsychotics. To gain further insight into the binding site, we examined the minimal structural changes necessary to transform low-affinity binding of dofetilide by the related bovine ether a-go-go channel bEAG to high-affinity binding of HERG. Previously, it was shown that high-affinity binding in HERG required intact C-type inactivation; the bovine ether a-go-go K(+) channel (bEAG), unlike HERG, is noninactivating. Therefore, we introduced C-type inactivation into noninactivating bEAG using site-directed mutagenesis. Two point mutations in the pore region, T432S and A443S, were sufficient to produce C-type inactivation. Low concentrations of dofetilide produced block of bEAG T432S/A443S; unlike HERG, block was almost irreversible. Substitution of an additional amino acid in transmembrane domain S6 made the block reversible. Dofetilide blocked the triply mutated bEAG T432S/A443S/A453S with an IC(50) value of 1.1 microM. The blocking potency was 30-fold greater than bEAG WT and about one third that of HERG WT. We conclude that high affinity methanesulfonanilide binding to HERG channels is strongly dependent on C-type inactivation.
11728190	Novel tropane-based irreversible ligands for the dopamine transporter.	3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropane (benztropine) and its analogues are tropane ring-containing dopamine uptake inhibitors that display binding and behavioral profiles that are distinct from cocaine. We previously prepared a benztropine-based photoaffinity label [125I]-(N-[4-(4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl)butyl]-3alpha-[bis(4'-fluorophenyl)methoxy]tropane, [125I]1, that covalently attached to the 1-2 transmembrane spanning region of the dopamine transporter (DAT). This was in contrast to the 4-7 transmembrane spanning region labeled by a cocaine-based photoaffinity label, [125I] 2 (RTI 82). To characterize further these different binding domains, photoaffinity ligands that had the 4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl substituent extended from the same position on the tropane ring were desirable. Thus, identification of the optimal alkyl linker between this substituent and the tropane nitrogen in the benztropine series was investigated to ultimately prepare the identical N-substituted analogue of 2. In this pursuit, the N-[4-(4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl)propyl] analogue of 3alpha-[bis(4'-fluorophenyl)methoxy]tropane (9a) was synthesized as well as two isothiocyanate analogues that do not require photoactivation (10a,b) for irreversible binding. The synthesis of these target compounds was achieved using a modification of the strategy developed for 1. Evaluation of these compounds for displacing [3H]WIN 35 428 binding at DAT in rat caudate putamen revealed that the 4'-azido-3'-iodophenylbutyl substituent, found in 1, provided optimal binding affinity and was chosen to replace the N-CH3 group on 2. Both the 4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl- and the 4'-isothiocyanatophenylbutyl analogues of 2 (25 and 26, respectively) were synthesized. Both products bound to DAT with comparable potency (IC(50) = 30 nM) to RTI 82 (2). In addition, compound 26 demonstrated wash-resistant displacement of [3H]WIN 35 428 in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with hDAT. These ligands will provide important tools for further characterizing the binding domains for tropane-based dopamine uptake inhibitors at the DAT.
11729362	Ketoprofen-induced cyclooxygenase inhibition in renal medulla and platelets of rats treated with caffeine.	It has been suggested that caffeine can augment analgesic activity and aggravate side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible interaction between ketoprofen and caffeine on prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis and cyclooxygenase (COX) mRNA expression in the rat renal medulla ex vivo. Treatment of rats with ketoprofen (60 min before) resulted in a dose-dependent (estimated ID(50) 0.3 mg/kg p.o.) reduction of PGE(2) biosynthesis in renal medulla ex vivo. Ketoprofen (0.3 mg/kg)-induced inhibition of PGE(2) biosynthesis was stable between 30 and 180 min and still detectable 300 min after drug administration. Caffeine (10 mg/kg) did not cause a detectable effect on its own, nor did it significantly affect ketoprofen-induced inhibition of renal medullary PGE(2) biosynthesis. Similar results were obtained with repeated daily drug administration for 1 week: there was no significant effect of caffeine on ketoprofen-induced inhibition of renal medullary PGE(2) biosynthesis. The absence of significant caffeine effects on ketoprofen-induced inhibition of renal medullary PGE(2) biosynthesis was paralleled by experiments showing no significant effect of caffeine on ketoprofen-induced inhibition of platelet thromboxane (TX)B(2) biosynthesis. Additional experiments showed increased COX-2 mRNA expression in the renal medulla 60 min after ketoprofen administration, that was not significantly influenced by concomitant caffeine treatment. Treatment of rats with ketoprofen for 1 week had no significant effects on COX-2 mRNA expression. The present results show that ketoprofen caused inhibition of PGE(2) biosynthesis in the rat renal medulla ex vivo with a potency similar to that reported for in vivo models suggesting that the ex vivo approach is a valid model to test a possible interference of caffeine with ketoprofen-induced COX inhibition. The absence of detectable effects of caffeine on time course or magnitude of ketoprofen-induced suppression of PGE(2) biosynthesis in this model indicates, therefore, that possible adverse actions of co-administered caffeine on renal function are not related to interference with renal COX inhibition.
11740958	Bimatoprost and its free acid are prostaglandin FP receptor agonists.	Bimatoprost (17-phenyl-prostaglandin F(2alpha) ethyl amide) has been reported not to exert its actions via prostaglandin receptors. Here, bimatoprost displaced [3H]prostaglandin F(2alpha) from FP receptors (K(i)=6310+/-1650 nM). Bimatoprost rapidly mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) via cloned human FP receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (EC(50)=2940+/-1663 nM) and via native FP receptors in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (EC(50)=2200+/-670 nM). Furthermore, AL-8810 ((5Z, 13E)-(9S,11S,15R)-9,15-dihydroxy-11-fluoro-15-(2-indanyl)-16,17,18,19,20-pentanor-5,13-prostadienoic acid), an FP receptor antagonist, blocked the bimatoprost-induced [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization.
11741727	A simple cell line based in vitro test system for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligands.	The generation of cell lines stably expressing the functional recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NRs) and their use for ligand testing in a simple excitotoxicity model is described. The mouse fibroblast cell line L(tk-) was co-transfected stably with cDNAs encoding the human NR subunits, NR1-1a/NR2A or NR1-1a/NR2B, respectively. The NR expression and functionality in resulting clones have been verified by RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and fluo-4 calcium imaging. Stimulation of NR expressing clones with L-glutamate and glycine resulted in necrosis of cultures within 1 h. Therefore, a lactate dehydrogenase-based excitotoxicity assay was used for the pharmacological characterisation. The two selected clones exhibited pharmacological properties corresponding to the distinct NR subunit assemblies. Both cell lines showed proton inhibition of cell death in the range of physiological pH. EC50-values for L-glutamate under saturated D-serine concentrations were 3.7 microM for L12-G10 (NR1-1a/NR2A) and 2.8 microM for L13-E6 (NR1-1a/NR2B), respectively. Competitive antagonists (RS)-APV and (RS)-CPP as well as glycine B site antagonist DCKA prevented L-glutamate/glycine-induced cell death. NR2B selective antagonists such as ifenprodil or haloperidol did only protect L13-E6 cells. Spermine (300 microM) triggered cell death selectively in the L13-E6 clone in a pH-dependent manner.
11746710	Non-amines, drugs without an amine nitrogen, potently block serotonin transport: novel antidepressant candidates?	The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a principal site of action of therapeutic antidepressants in the brain. Without exception, these inhibitors of serotonin transport contain an amine nitrogen in their structure. We previously demonstrated that novel compounds without an amine nitrogen in their structure (non-amines), blocked dopamine transport in cells transfected with the human dopamine transporter. The present study investigated whether, in the absence of an amine nitrogen, certain non-amines bind selectively to the SERT and block the transport of serotonin. At 10 microM concentration, select non-amines displayed no, or little, affinity for 9 serotonin, 5 dopamine, 7 adrenergic, 5 muscarinic cholinergic, 3 opiate and histamine receptors. The affinities of non-amines for [(3)H]citalopram binding sites on the SERT and their potencies for blocking [(3)H]serotonin transport were measured in cloned human SERT stably or transiently expressed in HEK-293. Whether oxa- or carba-based, non-amines bound to [(3)H]citalopram-labeled sites and blocked [(3)H]serotonin transport in the low nanomolar range, at values equal to or higher than those of some conventional antidepressants. A non-amine, O-1809, was 99-fold more selective for the serotonin over the dopamine transporter. As substituents on the aromatic ring of non-amines confer high affinity for the SERT, we investigated the hypothesis that aromatic-aromatic interactions may contribute significantly to non-amine/transporter association. A SERT mutant was produced in which a highly conserved aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine 548, was replaced by an alanine (F548A). Although the affinities of several non-amines were unchanged in the mutant SERT, the affinity of imipramine was decreased, revealing possible differences in amine and non-amine binding domains on the SERT. The similar affinities of non-amines and conventional antidepressant drugs for the SERT support the view that an amine nitrogen is not essential for drugs to block serotonin transport with high affinity. Non-amines open avenues for developing a new generation of antidepressants.
11747436	Neomycin B-arginine conjugate, a novel HIV-1 Tat antagonist: synthesis and anti-HIV activities.	HIV-1 transactivating protein Tat is essential for virus replication and progression of HIV disease. HIV-1 Tat stimulates transactivation by binding to HIV-1 transactivator responsive element (TAR) RNA, and while secreted extracellularly, it acts as an immunosuppressor, an activator of quiescent T-cells for productive HIV-1 infection, and by binding to CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) as a chemokine analogue. Here we present a novel HIV-1 Tat antagonist, a neomycin B-hexaarginine conjugate (NeoR), which inhibits Tat transactivation and antagonizes Tat extracellular activities, such as increased viral production, induction of CXCR4 expression, suppression of CD3-activated proliferation of lymphocytes, and upregulation of the CD8 receptor. Moreover, Tat inhibits binding of fluoresceine isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled NeoR to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), indicating that Tat and NeoR bind to the same cellular target. This is further substantiated by the finding that NeoR competes with the binding of monoclonal Abs to CXCR4. Furthermore, NeoR suppresses HIV-1 binding to cells. Importantly, NeoR accumulates in the cell nuclei and inhibits the replication of M- and T-tropic HIV-1 laboratory isolates (EC(50) = 0.8-5.3 microM). A putative model structure for the TAR-NeoR complex, which complies with available experimental data, is presented. We conclude that NeoR is a multitarget HIV-1 inhibitor; the structure, and molecular modeling and dynamics, suggest its binding to TAR RNA. NeoR inhibits HIV-1 binding to cells, partially by blocking the CXCR4 HIV-1 coreceptor, and it antagonizes Tat functions. NeoR is therefore an attractive lead compound, capable of interfering with different stages of HIV infection and AIDS pathogenesis.
11747625	Mapping of IFN-beta epitopes important for receptor binding and biologic activation: comparison of results achieved using antibody-based methods and alanine substitution mutagenesis.	The epitopes important for receptor binding and activation of human interferon-beta1a (IFN-beta1a) were mapped with monoclonal antibodies (mAb), grouped on the basis of their specificity and ability to neutralize biologic activity, and alanine scanning mutagenesis (ASM). The binding properties of nine mAb were defined, using ASM-IFN-beta mutants having alanine substituted at targeted, surface-exposed residues. The results were correlated with the mAb neutralizing potency. Of six mAb that bound either at or adjacent to the IFNAR-2 receptor chain binding site defined by the ASM epitopes, only three had measurable neutralizing activity. Two of these inhibited IFN-beta/IFNAR-2 complex formation, suggesting that steric hindrance of receptor binding constitutes their mechanism of neutralization. However, two mAb that bound to sites remote from the IFNAR-2 binding site on IFN-beta also inhibited IFN-beta/IFNAR-2 complex formation and demonstrated potent neutralizing activity. Thus, neutralizing mAb may employ mechanisms other than steric blockade to inhibit directly the binding of receptor by cytokine, limiting their usefulness as tools to define precise receptor-ligand interaction sites.
11752096	In vivo selection of antifolate-resistant transgenic hematopoietic stem cells in a murine bone marrow transplant model.	Currently, low levels of stable gene transfer into hematopoietic tissues of large animals and humans continues to limit the clinical application of gene therapy. One strategy for overcoming this problem is to selectively expand, in vivo, the population of successfully gene-modified cells. Recent work has shown that nucleoside transport inhibition in combination with antifolates can be used to select in vivo for hematopoietic stem cells expressing drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In this study we investigated whether trimetrexate (TMTX) and the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose phosphate (NBMPR-P) can be used to select for tyr22-variant DHFR expressing transgenic hematopoietic cells in a murine bone marrow transplant model. Our results indicate that 40 mg/kg TMTX and 20 mg/kg NBMPR-P can be used in combination to expand transgene-positive progenitor cells 3- to 4-fold immediately following drug administration. In addition, long-term progenitor populations were expanded 2- to 3-fold in primary recipients, to approximately 5 months following drug administration. Secondary transplants conducted with marrow from primary recipients 5 months following drug administration revealed a statistically significant selective expansion of transgene-positive cells in the spleens and peripheral blood of these animals. No such expansion was observed in groups of mice treated with TMTX alone or NBMPR-P alone. We conclude that TMTX + NBMPR-P can be used to selectively expand transgenic tyr22-variant DHFR expressing murine hematopoietic stem cells in vivo.
11783365	[Effects of mifepristone on expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in cultured human eutopic and ectopic endometria].	To investigate the effects of mifepristone on expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in cultured human eutopic and ectopic endometria.
11785774	Involvement of constitutive (COX-1) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in the adrenergic-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion.	The involvement of prostaglandins synthesized by constitutive (COX-1) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in central stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by adrenergic receptor agonists was investigated in conscious rats. COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor, piroxicam (0.02 and 0.2 microg) and compound NS-398 (0.01 and 0.1 microg), respectively, were given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) 15 min prior to i.c.v. adrenergic receptor agonists: phenylephrine (30 microg) and clonidine (10 microg), an alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic agonist, and isoprenaline (20 microg) a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist and clenbuterol (10 microg) a selective beta2-adrenergic agonist. Piroxicam and NS-398 considerably and dose-dependently reduced the phenylephrine-induced increase in ACTH and corticosterone secretion. Pretreatment with piroxicam and NS-398 markedly impaired the clonidine-evoked ACTH and corticosterone secretion. Piroxicam moderately diminished the isoprenaline-elicited increase in ACTH and corticosterone, while NS-398 did not markedly alter ACTH secretion. The clenbuterol-induced ACTH and corticosterone responses were considerably impaired by pretreatment with piroxicam, and slightly less potently by NS-398. These results indicate that in central structures involved in regulation of the HPA axis both constitutive and inducible cyclooxygenase are present under normal conditions in rats. These isoenzymes are significantly involved in the stimulatory signaling transduced by postsynaptic alpha1-adrenergic receptors and, to a lesser extent, by alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Both isoenzymes affect moderately the stimulatory action of a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist on ACTH and corticosterone secretion. COX-1 participates considerably and COX-2 markedly in the potent stimulatory action of selective beta2-adrenergic receptors on HPA axis.
11790786	Design, synthesis, and characterization of potent, slow-binding inhibitors that are selective for gelatinases.	Gelatinases have been shown to play a key role in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Small molecular weight synthetic inhibitors for these enzymes are highly sought for potential use as anti-metastatic agents. Virtually all of the known inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are broad spectrum. We report herein the synthesis and kinetic characterization of two compounds, 4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol (compound 1) and 5-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane-1,2-dithiol (compound 2), that are potent and selective gelatinase inhibitors. These compounds are slow, tight-binding inhibitors of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) with K(i) values in the nanomolar range. In contrast, competitive inhibition of the catalytic domain of membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase (MMP-14(cat)) with comparable K(i) values (K(i) approximately 200 nm) was observed. Binding to stromelysin (MMP-3) was substantially weaker, with K(i) values in the micromolar range (K(i) approximately 10 microm). No binding to matrilysin (MMP-7) and collagenase 1 (MMP-1) was detected at inhibitor concentrations up to 60 microm. We have previously shown that synthetic MMP inhibitors work synergistically with TIMP-2 in the promotion of pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP in a process that depends on the affinity of the inhibitor toward MT1-MMP. It is shown herein that the dithiols are significantly less efficient (>100-fold) than marimastat, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, in enhancing pro-MMP-2 activation in cells infected to express MT1-MMP, consistent with the lower affinity of the dithiols toward MT1-MMP. Thus, in contrast to broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors, the dithiols are less likely to promote MT1-MMP-dependent pro-MMP-2 activation in the presence of TIMP-2, while maintaining their ability to inhibit active MMP-2 effectively.
11805217	Immunopharmacological potential of selective phosphodiesterase inhibition. I. Differential regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) biosynthesis in alveolar epithelial cells.	In an attempt to elaborate in vitro on a therapeutic strategy that counteracts an inflammatory signal, we previously reported a novel immunopharmacological potential of glutathione, an antioxidant thiol, in regulating inflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that selective regulation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), a family of enzymes that controls intracellular cAMP/cGMP degradation, differentially regulates proinflammatory cytokines. Selective PDE1 inhibition (8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) blockaded lipopolysaccharide-endotoxin (LPS)-mediated biosynthesis of interleukin (IL)-6, but this pathway had no inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Furthermore, inhibition of PDE3 (amrinone) abolished the effect of LPS on IL-6, but attenuated TNF-alpha production. Reversible competitive inhibition of PDE4 (rolipram) exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on IL-6 and a dual, biphasic (excitatory/inhibitory) effect on TNF-alpha secretion. Blockading PDE5 (4-[[3',4'-(methylenedioxy)benzyl] amino]-6-methoxyquinazoline) showed a high potency in reducing IL-6 production, but in a manner similar to the inhibition of PDE4, exhibited a biphasic effect on TNF-alpha biosynthesis. Simultaneous inhibition of PDE5, 6, and 9 (zaprinast), purported to specifically elevate intracellular cGMP, reduced, in a dose-independent manner, IL-6 and TNF-alpha biosynthesis. Finally, nonselective inhibition of PDE by pentoxifylline suppressed LPS-mediated secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The involvement of specific PDE isoenzymes in differentially regulating LPS-mediated inflammatory cytokine biosynthesis indicates a novel approach to unravel the potential therapeutic targets that these isozymes constitute during the progression of inflammation within the respiratory epithelium.
11814865	Synthesis and biological testing of Acyl-CoA-ketoprofen conjugates as selective irreversible inhibitors of COX-2.	Ketoprofenoyl-CoA thioester 3 was synthesized by coupling ketoprofen to coenzyme A using the mixed anhydride method. Diastereoisomeric compounds 3a and 3b corresponding to the enantiomers of ketoprofen, were obtained in optically pure form by preparative HPLC. A non-acylating analogue, rac-3-(3-benzoylphenyl)-2-oxo-butanoyl-CoA (7) was also prepared. The biological evaluation suggested that 3a and 3b are reversible inhibitors of COX-1 and irreversible inhibitors of COX-2. Compound 7 appears to be a poor but selective inhibitor of COX-1.
11817517	Influence of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region on the antidepressant response to fluvoxamine in Japanese depressed patients.	The presence of the long (l) variant of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is reported to be associated with a more favorable and faster antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in Caucasians. The frequency of the l allele is lower in Japanese than in Caucasians; therefore, the antidepressant effect of fluvoxamine can be not as good in Japanese as in Caucasians. The authors investigated whether 5-HTTLPR was associated with the antidepressant response to fluvoxamine in 66 Japanese patients with major depressive disorder in a protocolized-dosing 6-week study. The short (s) allele frequency was significantly higher in the responsive individuals than in the nonresponsive ones (P = .010). The present study suggests that fluvoxamine is not less effective in depressive patients carrying the s allele than in the ones carrying the l allele and it is not less effective in Japanese than in Caucasians.
11819669	Stimulation by nizatidine, a histamine H(2)-receptor antagonist, of duodenal HCO(3)(-)secretion in rats:relation to anti-cholinesterase activity.	AIM:To examine whether nizatidine stimulates duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion in rats by inhibiting AChE activity.METHODS:Under pentobarbital anesthesia, a proximal duodenal loop was perfused with saline, and the HCO(3)(-) secretion was measured at pH 7.0 using a pH-stat method and by adding 10mM HCl. Nizatidine, neostigmine, carbachol or famotidine was administered i.v. as a single injection.RESULTS:Intravenous administration of nizatidine (3-30mg/kg) dose-dependently increased duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion, and the effect at 10mg/kg was equivalent to that obtained by carbachol at 0.01mg/kg. This nizatidine action was observed at the same dose range that inhibited acid secretion and enhanced gastric motility, mimicked by i.v. injection of neostigmine(0.03mg/kg), and significantly attenuated by bilateral vagotomy and prior s.c. administration of atropine but not by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a NO synthase inhibitor. The HCO(3)(-) secretory response to acetylcholine (0.001mg/kg) was significantly potentiated by the concurrent administration of nizatidine (3mg/kg,i.v.). The IC(50) of nizatidine for AChE of rat erythrocytes was 1.4·10(-6) M, about 12 times higher than that of neostigmine. Neither famotidine (> 10(-3) M, 30mg/kg, i.v.) nor cisapride (> 10(-3) M,3mg/kg, i.v.) had any influence on AChE activity or duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion. Duodenal damage induced by acid perfusion (100mM HCl for 4h) in the presence of indomethacin was significantly prevented by nizatidine and neostigmine, at the doses that increased the HCO(3)(-)secretion.CONCLUSION:Nizatidine stimulates duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion, in both vagal dependent and atropine sensitive manners, and the action is associated with the anti-AChE activity of this agent.
11823786	Excitatory glycine receptors containing the NR3 family of NMDA receptor subunits.	The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (NMDAR) serves critical functions in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system, including neuronal development, plasticity and neurodegeneration. Conventional heteromeric NMDARs composed of NR1 and NR2A-D subunits require dual agonists, glutamate and glycine, for activation. They are also highly permeable to Ca2+, and exhibit voltage-dependent inhibition by Mg2+. Coexpression of NR3A with NR1 and NR2 subunits modulates NMDAR activity. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the final member of the NMDAR family, NR3B, which shares high sequence homology with NR3A. From in situ and immunocytochemical analyses, NR3B is expressed predominantly in motor neurons, whereas NR3A is more widely distributed. Remarkably, when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, NR3A or NR3B co-assembles with NR1 to form excitatory glycine receptors that are unaffected by glutamate or NMDA, and inhibited by D-serine, a co-activator of conventional NMDARs. Moreover, NR1/NR3A or -3B receptors form relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+, MK-801, memantine and competitive antagonists. In cerebrocortical neurons containing NR3 family members, glycine triggers a burst of firing, and membrane patches manifest glycine-responsive single channels that are suppressible by D-serine. By itself, glycine is normally thought of as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In contrast, these NR1/NR3A or -3B 'NMDARs' constitute a type of excitatory glycine receptor.
11834888	Comparison of furosemide and vinblastine secretion from cell lines overexpressing multidrug resistance protein (P-glycoprotein) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP1 and MRP2).	Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that the loop diuretic, furosemide, is actively secreted by Caco-2 cells and rat jejunal tissue. This active secretion could be the result of efflux transporters such as P-gp, MRP1 or MRP2 (cMOAT). To determine if any of these transporters is responsible for the secretion of furosemide, we compared directional permeability in the wild-type cell lines, MDCK strains I and II, and LLC-PK1, vs. cell lines that overexpress a single transporter, in both the presence and absence of various inhibitors, for furosemide as compared to vinblastine. Sulfinpyrazone significantly inhibited the transport of vinblastine in MRP2 expressing cells, but not the wild-type controls. Vinblastine could not be confirmed as a substrate of MRP1. We were also unable to demonstrate that any particular transporter affected furosemide in excess of the background effects of endogenous transporters in the parental cell lines. Furosemide secretion from these kidney-derived cell lines is probably not the primary result of any of the well characterized efflux transporters (P-gp, MRP1 or MRP2), although they may still play a role in the observed Caco-2 secretion. This equivocal result acknowledges the difficulty in trying to determine the effect of a single protein in a complicated expression system.
11854433	Channel blockers acting at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors: differential effects of mutations in the vestibule and ion channel pore.	A large number of structurally diverse compounds act as open-channel blockers of NMDA receptors. They may share discrete or overlapping binding sites within the channel. In this study, the effects of mutations in and around the membrane-spanning and pore-forming regions of NMDA receptor subunits were studied with three blockers, MK-801, memantine, and TB-3-4, using recombinant NMDA receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Mutations at the critical asparagine residues in the M2 loop of NR1 and NR2B and at a tryptophan residue in M2 of NR2B reduced block by MK-801, memantine, and TB-3-4. Mutations at residues in the pre-M1, M1, M3, post-M3, and post-M4 regions had differential effects on the three blockers. Many mutations in these regions reduced block by MK-801 and TB-3-4 but had no effect on block by memantine. The differential effects on block by memantine and MK-801 are unlikely to be caused by differences in the size of these blockers. Benzyl rings in MK-801 and TB-3-4 may make hydrophobic interactions with aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues in the pore. Some mutations in the pre-M1 and M3 regions generated constitutively open channels, characterized by large holding currents. The effects of the various mutants are discussed in the context of models based on the known structure of the pore of the KcsA potassium channel and on previous studies dealing with solvent accessible residues in NMDA receptor subunits as determined by modification after cysteine mutagenesis.
11869873	Effects of 3-MeSO2-DDE and some CYP inhibitors on glucocorticoid steroidogenesis in the H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line.	The formation of steroids in the H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line was analysed by HPLC or RIA, and based on these data the apparent catalytic activities of CYP11A, CYP17, CYP21 and CYP11B1 in this cell line were calculated. The environmental pollutant 3-methylsulfonyl-DDE (3-MeSO2-DDE) and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors ketoconazole, metyrapone and aminoglutethimide were studied for their effects on the steroid formation. Metyrapone (IC50) of 1 microM) and 3-MeSO2-DDE (10 microM: 66 +/- 10% of control) were found to inhibit the apparent CYP11B1 activity. Ketoconazole inhibited all enzymes examined with the greatest effects on CYP11B1 (IC50) of 2.5 microM). Aminoglutethimide was examined only for effects on CYP11A activity and was shown to inhibit pregnenolone formation (20 microM: 61 +/- 4% of control). The possibility of studying all CYP enzymes in the corticosteroidogenesis makes this cell line a valuable test system to examine effects of chemicals, such as suspected endocrine disruptors, on the human glucocorticoid hormone synthesis. The inhibition of cortisol formation by 3-MeSO2-DDE supports an interaction with the active site of CYP11B1, as previously reported in mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells. In mice, this interaction led to metabolic activation and a high adrenotoxicity of 3-MeSO2-DDE. Therefore studies on the adrenotoxicity of 3-MeSO2-DDE in humans are needed.
11874390	5-HT1B-receptors and vascular reactivity in human isolated blood vessels: assessment of the potential craniovascular selectivity of sumatriptan.	5-HT1B-receptor mediated vasoconstriction of cranial arteries is a potential mechanism by which 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonists such as sumatriptan produce their antimigraine effects. 5-HT1B-receptors exist in other blood vessels which may give rise to unwanted vascular effects. Therefore we examined the distribution of 5-HT1B-receptor immunoreactivity (i.r.) in human blood vessels (including target and nontarget vessels) and confirmed the functionality of this receptor protein, by comparing the vasoconstrictor effects of sumatriptan and 5-HT (the endogenous ligand) in isolated vessels.
11889204	Cytochrome P450-catalyzed binding of 3-methylsulfonyl-DDE and o,p'-DDD in human adrenal zona fasciculata/reticularis.	3-Methylsulfonyl-2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1'-dichloroethene (MeSO(2)-DDE) is a potent, tissue-specific toxicant that induces necrosis of the adrenal zona fasciculata following a local CYP11B1-catalyzed activation to a reactive intermediate in mice. Autoradiography was used to examine CYP11B1-catalyzed binding of MeSO(2)-[(14)C]DDE and the adrenocorticolytic drug 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichlorethane; (o,p'-[(14)C]DDD, Mitotane, Lysodren) in human adrenal tissue slice culture. Both compounds gave rise to a selective binding in the one sample of normal adrenal zona fasciculata/reticularis, leaving zona glomerulosa and the adrenal medulla devoid of binding. Addition of the CYP11B1 selective inhibitor metyrapone (50 microM) reduced MeSO(2)-[(14)C]DDE binding below the detection limit, whereas o,p'-[(14)C]DDD binding was reduced only by 42%. Selective binding of MeSO(2)-[(14)C]DDE and o,p'-[(14)C]DDD was also observed in an aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma and in a nonfunctional adrenocortical hyperplasia. Exposure of slices from the normal adrenal cortex to MeSO(2)-DDE (25 microM) resulted in an increased accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione in the medium, and exposure to o,p'-DDD (25 microM) did not alter the steroid secretion pattern. No histological changes were found in either MeSO(2)-DDE- or o,p'-DDD-exposed slices, compared with nonexposed slices. We suggest that MeSO(2)-DDE might act as a potent adrenocorticolytic agent in humans. Further studies are needed to establish the usefulness of MeSO(2)-DDE as a possible alternative for the treatment of adrenocortical hypersecretion and tumor growth.
11890515	The phosphodiesterase inhibitory selectivity and the in vitro and in vivo potency of the new PDE5 inhibitor vardenafil.	We investigated the potency and the selectivity profile of vardenafil on phosphodiesterase (PDEs) enzymes, its ability to modify cGMP metabolism and cause relaxation of penile smooth muscle and its effect on erections in vivo under conditions of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. PDE isozymes were extracted and purified from human platelets (PDE5) or bovine sources (PDEs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6). The inhibition of these PDEs and of human recombinant PDEs by vardenafil was determined. The ability to potentiate NO-mediated relaxation and influence cGMP levels in human corpus cavernosum strips was measured in vitro, and erection-inducing activity was demonstrated in conscious rabbits after oral administration together with intravenous doses of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The effects of vardenafil were compared with those of the well-recognized PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (values for sildenafil in brackets). Vardenafil specifically inhibited the hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE5 with an IC50 of 0.7 nM (6.6 nM). In contrast, the IC50 of vardenafil for PDE1 was 180 nM; for PDE6, 11 nM; for PDE2, PDE3 and PDE4, more than 1000 nM. Relative to PDE5, the ratios of the IC50 for PDE1 were 257 (60), for PDE6 16 (7.4). Vardenafil significantly enhanced the SNP-induced relaxation of human trabecular smooth muscle at 3 nM (10 nM). Vardenafil also significantly potentiated both ACh-induced and transmural electrical stimulation-induced relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle. The minimum concentration of vardenafil that significantly potentiated SNP-induced cGMP accumulation was 3 nM (30 nM). In vivo studies in rabbits showed that orally administered vardenafil dose-dependently potentiated erectile responses to intravenously administered SNP. The minimal effective dose that significantly potentiated erection was 0.1 mg/kg (1 mg/kg). The selectivity for PDE5, the potentiation of NO-induced relaxation and cGMP accumulation in human trabecular smooth muscle and the ability to enhance NO-induced erection in vivo indicate that vardenafil has the appropriate properties to be a potential compound for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Vardenafil was more potent and selective than sildenafil on its inhibitory activity on PDE5.
11897116	The role of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the selective inhibitory effect of naratriptan on trigeminovascular neurons.	The importance of 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors in the actions of the anti-migraine drug naratriptan was investigated using the relatively selective 5-HT(1) receptor ligands SB224289 and BRL15572. Electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in cats activated neurones in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Facial receptive fields (RF) were also electrically stimulated to activate the same neurones. Responses of these neurones to SSS stimulation were suppressed by iontophoretic application of naratriptan (5-50 nA). There were two distinct populations of neurones in the nucleus--those in deeper laminae in which the responses to SSS and RF stimulation were equally suppressed by naratriptan ('non-selective') and more superficial neurones in which only the SSS responses were suppressed by naratriptan ('selective'). Concurrent micro-iontophoretic application (50 nA) of the 5-HT(1D) antagonist BRL15572 antagonised the suppression by naratriptan of the response of 'selective' cells to SSS stimulation. Iontophoretic application of SB224289 (50 nA), a 5-HT(1B) antagonist, antagonised the suppression by naratriptan of responses of 'non-selective' cells to RF stimulation and, to a lesser extent, also antagonised the suppression of responses to SSS stimulation. Intravenous administration of SB224289 antagonised the suppression only of RF responses of "non-selective" neurons by naratriptan and intravenous administration of BRL15572 antagonised the suppression only of SSS responses of "selective" neurons by naratriptan. These results suggest that the response of nucleus caudalis neurons to stimulation of the sagittal sinus can be modulated by both 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptor activation, with the 5-HT(1D) receptors perhaps playing a greater role. The response to RF stimulation is more influenced by 5-HT(1B) receptor modulation with 5-HT(1D) receptors being less important. Therefore, this suggests that selective 5-HT(1D) agonists may be able to target the neuronal population, which is selectively involved in the transmission of dural inputs. We conclude that the central terminals of trigeminal primary afferent fibres contain 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors. Primary afferents from the dura mater may predominantly express 5-HT(1D) receptors, while facial afferents may predominantly express 5-HT(1B) receptors. Activation of 5-HT(1D) receptors in particular may be important in the anti-migraine effect of naratriptan.
11899840	[Tricyclic antidepressants as inhibitors of brain glutathione-S-transferase].	Tricyclic antidepressants, amitriptyline, doxepin--derivatives of cycloheptadiene as well as imipramine and clomipramine, derivatives of dibenzazepine inhibit the activity of glutathione-S-transferase pi isolated from different regions of human brain (parietal cortex, frontal cortex, brain stem). The inhibitory effect of studied drugs depends more on their chemical structure than on brain localization of the enzyme. All tricyclics bind nonspecifically to the effector site of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The obtained results indicate that the inhibitory effect of tricyclic antidepressants on brain GST may decrease the efficiency of the enzymatic barrier, which protects brain against toxic electrophiles, and contribute in their adverse effects. On the other hand, brain GST may decrease the therapeutic effects of tricyclic antidepressants by binding them as ligands.
11906285	Structural basis for the glucocorticoid response in a mutant human androgen receptor (AR(ccr)) derived from an androgen-independent prostate cancer.	The crystal structure of a mutant androgen receptor (AR) ligand-binding domain (LBD) in complex with the agonist 9alpha-fluorocortisol has been determined at 1.95 A resolution. This mutant AR contains two mutations (L701H and T877A) and was previously reported as a high-affinity cortisol/cortisone responsive AR (AR(ccr)) isolated from the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines MDA PCa 2a and 2b (Zhao et al. Nature Med. 2000, 6, 703-6). The three-dimensional structure of the AR(ccr) LBD complexed with 9alpha-fluorocortisol shows the typical conformation of an agonist-bound nuclear receptor in which helix 12 is precisely positioned as a "lid" for the ligand-binding pocket. Binding of 9alpha-fluorocortisol to the AR(ccr) involves favorable hydrogen bond patterns on the C17 and C21 substituents of the ligand due to the mutations at 701 and 877 in the AR(ccr). Our studies provide the first structural explanation for the glucocorticoid activation of AR(ccr), which is important for the development of new therapeutic treatments for androgen-independent prostate cancer.
11910268	The anxiolytic effect of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone compared with diazepam in subjects anxious before dental surgery.	The novel atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone has a pharmacologic profile notable for potent agonism of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors, antagonism at 5-HT1D receptors, and reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. 5-HT1A receptor agonism, in particular, suggests anxiolytic activity, and ziprasidone has shown preliminary efficacy in treating the symptoms of anxiety associated with psychotic disorders. In this study, the anxiolytic efficacy of ziprasidone was evaluated in nonpsychotic subjects who were anxious before undergoing minor dental surgery. We compared a single oral dose of 20 mg ziprasidone (N = 30) with that of 10 mg diazepam (N = 30) and placebo (N = 30) in a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study. The peak anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone compared with that of placebo was similar to that of diazepam but had a later onset. At 3 hours postdose, the anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone was significantly greater than that of placebo (p < 0.05) and somewhat greater than that of diazepam. Diazepam showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p < 0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension were not seen with ziprasidone. Thus, ziprasidone may possess anxiolytic effects in addition to its antipsychotic properties.
11916794	Tramadol inhibits norepinephrine transporter function at desipramine-binding sites in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells.	Tramadol is a widely used analgesic, but its mode of action is not well understood. To study the effects of tramadol on norepinephrine transporter (NET) function, we assayed the effect of tramadol on [3H]-norepinephrine ([3H]-NE) uptake and [3H]-desipramine binding to plasma membranes isolated from bovine adrenal medulla. We then characterized [14C]-tramadol binding in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Tramadol inhibited the desipramine-sensitive uptake of [3H]-NE by the cells in a concentration-dependent manner (50% inhibitory concentration = 21.5 +/- 6.0 microM). Saturation analysis revealed that tramadol increased the apparent Michaelis constant of [3H]-NE uptake without changing the maximal velocity, indicating that inhibition occurred via competition for the NET (inhibition constant, K(i) = 13.7 microM). Tramadol inhibited the specific binding of [3H]-desipramine to plasma membranes. Scatchard analysis of [3H]-desipramine binding revealed that tramadol increased the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) for binding without altering maximal binding, indicating competitive inhibition (K(i) = 11.2 microM). The binding of [14C]-tramadol to the cells was specific and saturable, with a K(d) of 18.1 +/- 2.4 microM. These findings indicate that tramadol competitively inhibits NET function at desipramine-binding sites.
11920914	Peripheral site ligands accelerate inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by neutral organophosphates.	The rates of inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) by paraoxon, haloxon, DDVP and enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates and cationic alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines were measured in the presence and absence of AChE peripheral site inhibitors: gallamine, d-tubocurarine, propidium, atropine and derivatives of coumarin. All ligands, except the coumarins, at submillimolar concentrations enhanced the rates of inhibition by neutral organophosphates, whereas inhibition rates by cationic organophosphates were decreased. When peripheral site ligand concentrations extended to millimolar concentrations the extent of the enhancement decreased, creating a well-shaped activation profile. Analysis of inhibition by DDVP revealed that peripheral site inhibitors increase the second-order reaction rates by increasing maximal rates of phosphorylation. These observations suggest that peripheral site ligands are capable of allosterically affecting the conformation of residues in the choline binding site of AChE, thus optimizing the position of the leaving group of uncharged organophosphates during the inhibition reaction.
11933204	Sequence variations in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) associated with human addiction to heroin.	Human mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) is the major site for the analgesic action of most opioid drugs such as morphine, methadone and heroin. It was previously reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon1 (c.118A-->G) of OPRM1 might modestly alter the affinity in beta-endorphin-Mu interaction. Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) the complete coding region of the OPRM1 gene was screened for SNPs in Han-Chinese heroin addicts and normal control. Three novel SNPs were detected, one in exon3, one in intron3 and one in the 3' untranslated region. The SNP c.118A-->G reportedly altered the interaction of Mu receptor with opioid had no statistically significant correlation with heroin addition in Han Chinese. However, addicted subjects with the SNP in intron2 (IVS2 +31G-->A) tended to show much higher heroin intake dosages than those without this SNP. We also observed that individuals carrying both SNP c.118A-->G and IVS2 +31G-->A consumed relatively more drugs compared to other addicts. Thus our study further highlights the importance of studing the various regions of the mu opioid receptor gene, coding as well as non-coding, for genetic markers that may be linked to, or directly contribute to opioid drug-seeking behavior.
11939936	Efficacy and safety of entacapone in Parkinson's disease patients with suboptimal levodopa response: a 6-month randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study in Germany and Austria (Celomen study).	To determine the efficacy and safety of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone, used as an adjunct to levodopa, in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
11944917	Interaction of S100 proteins with the antiallergic drugs, olopatadine, amlexanox, and cromolyn: identification of putative drug binding sites on S100A1 protein.	S100 proteins are a multigenic family of low-molecular-weight Ca(2+)-binding proteins comprising 19 members. These proteins undergo a conformational change by Ca(2+)-binding and consequently interact with their target proteins. Recently, we reported that two antiallergic drugs, Amlexanox and Cromolyn, bind to S100A12 and S100A13 of the S100 protein family. In the present study, we used a newly developed antiallergic drug, Olopatadine, as a ligand for affinity chromatography and examined binding specificity of the drug to S100 protein family. Olopatadine binds specifically to S100 proteins, such as S100A1, S100B, S100L, S100A12, and S100A13, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner but not to calmodulin. Mutagenesis study showed that amino acid residues 76-85 in S100A1 are necessary for its binding to Olopatadine. In contrast, residues 89-94 were identified as an Amlexanox-binding site in S100A1. Moreover, Olopatadine did not competitively inhibit S100A1-binding site of Amlexanox. Furthermore, we showed that Olopatadine inhibited the binding of S100A1 target protein's binding site peptides to S100A1. These results indicate that C-terminal region of S100A1 is important for antiallergic drug binding, although the drug binding sites are different according to each antiallergic drug. Differences in the binding sites of S100A1 to antiallergic drugs suggest that the regulatory functions of S100 proteins may exist in several regions. Therefore, these drugs may serve as useful tools for evaluating the physiological significance of S100 protein family.
11948006	Topiramate as add-on drug in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy: an Italian multicenter open trial.	This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate (TPM) in patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) and refractory seizures.
11952155	Differential modulation of transforming growth factor-betas and cyclooxygenases in the platelet lysates of male F344 rats by dietary lipids and piroxicam.	Platelets are implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases including cancer. The main objective of the present study was to determine if dietary fish oil and piroxicam, known modulators of colon tumorigenesis, effect transforming growth factor (TGF)-betas and cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes in the platelets of colon tumor-bearing male F344 rats. TGF-betas and COXs are important in the development of chronic illnesses including colon cancer. Animals harboring preneoplastic colonic lesions were randomly allocated to a low fat diet (5% by weight--low corn oil, LFC) and three high fat diets (23% by weight--high corn oil, HFC; high corn oil containing 150-ppm piroxicam, HFC+P; and high fish oil, HFF) for 16 weeks. TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, COX-1 and COX-2 protein levels were assessed in the platelets by Western blot analysis. Active TGF-beta1 (12.5 kDa) level was significantly lower in the platelets of the HFC+P group (p < 0.001), whereas precursor TGF-beta1 (39 kDa) level was significantly lower in the platelets of the HFF group (p < 0.001). The anti-rabbit TGF-beta2 polyclonal antibody did not detect the 13-kDa active TGF-beta2 protein in the platelets. However a 29-kDa protein, potentially a precursor of TGF-beta2, was detected in the platelets of all the groups and was significantly lower in the HFC+P and HFF groups than in LFC and HFC (p < 0.001). COX-1 level was significantly lower in the HFF group than the other three groups (p < 0.001). COX-2 protein was detected in the platelets of all diet groups. Piroxicam in the presence of high corn oil (HFC+P) significantly lowered the level of COX-2 (p < 0.001), without having any effect on COX-1 level. These findings conclusively show that LFC and HFC differ from HFF and HFC+P, and piroxicam differs from fish oil, in regulating the levels of TGF-betas and COX in the platelets. This supports the conjecture that the levels of bioactive constituents of the platelets are profoundly modulated by dietary lipids, which in turn could influence the pathogenesis of chronic illnesses.
11956172	A glucocorticoid-responsive mutant androgen receptor exhibits unique ligand specificity: therapeutic implications for androgen-independent prostate cancer.	The cortisol/cortisone-responsive AR (AR(ccr)) has two mutations (L701H and T877A) that were found in the MDA PCa human prostate cancer cell lines established from a castrated patient whose metastatic tumor exhibited androgen-independent growth. Cortisol and cortisone bind to the AR(ccr) with high affinity. In the present study, we characterized the structural determinants for ligand binding to the AR(ccr). Our data revealed that many of the C17, C19, and C21 circulating steroids, at concentrations that are found in vivo, functioned as effective activators of the AR(ccr) but had little or no activity via the wild-type AR or GRalpha. Among the synthetic glucocorticoids tested, dexamethasone activated both GRalpha and AR(ccr), whereas triamcinolone was selective for GRalpha. In MDA PCa 2b cells, growth and prostate-specific antigen production were stimulated by potent AR(ccr) agonists such as cortisol or 9alpha-fluorocortisol but not by triamcinolone (which did not bind to or activate the AR(ccr)). Of the potential antagonists tested, bicalutamide (casodex) and GR antagonist RU38486 showed inhibitory activity. We postulate that corticosteroids provide a growth advantage to prostate cancer cells harboring the promiscuous AR(ccr) in androgen-ablated patients and contribute to their transition to androgen-independence. We predict that triamcinolone, a commonly prescribed glucocorticoid, would be a successful therapeutic agent for men with this form of cancer, perhaps in conjunction with the antagonist casodex. We hypothesize that triamcinolone administration would inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, thus suppressing endogenous corticosteroids, which stimulate tumor growth. Triamcinolone, by itself, would not activate the AR(ccr) or promote tumor growth but would provide glucocorticoid activity essential for survival.
11961144	Further insight into mechanism of action of clodronate: inhibition of mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase by a nonhydrolyzable, adenine-containing metabolite.	Bisphosphonates are currently the most important class of antiresorptive drugs used for the treatment of diseases with excess bone resorption. Recent studies have shown that bisphosphonates can be divided into two groups with distinct molecular mechanisms of action depending on the nature of the R(2) side chain. Alendronate, like other nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, inhibits bone resorption and causes apoptosis of osteoclasts and other cells in vitro by preventing post-translational modification of GTP-binding proteins with isoprenoid lipids. Clodronate, a bisphosphonate that lacks a nitrogen, does not inhibit protein isoprenylation but can be metabolized intracellularly to a beta-gamma-methylene (AppCp-type) analog of ATP, which is cytotoxic to macrophages in vitro. The detailed molecular basis for the cytotoxic effects of adenosine-5'-[beta,gamma-dichloromethylene]triphosphate (AppCCl(2)p) has not been determined yet. We addressed this question by studying the effects of alendronate, clodronate, and the clodronate metabolite AppCCl(2)p on isolated mitochondria, mitochondrial fractions, and mitochondrial membrane potential in isolated human osteoclasts. We found that AppCCl(2)p inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption by a mechanism that involves competitive inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocase. Alendronate or the native form of clodronate did not have any immediate effect on mitochondria. However, longer treatment with liposome-encapsulated clodronate caused collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, although prominent apoptosis was a late event. Hence, inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocase by the metabolite AppCCl(2)p is a likely route by which clodronate causes osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits bone resorption.
12010765	Involvement of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in sumatriptan mediated vasocontractile response in rabbit common carotid artery.	1. In this study we examined the involvement of 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors in the vasocontractile response induced by 5-HT(1B/D)-receptor agonist sumatriptan in rabbit common carotid artery (CCA). 2. Immunoblotting experiments using specific antisera against 5-HT(1B) or 5-HT(1D) receptors revealed the presence of one weak (at 93 kD for 5-HT(1B) or at 105 kD for 5-HT(1D)) and one strong band (at 46 kD for 5-HT(1B) or at 52 kD for 5-HT(1D)) in CCA. 3. Sumatriptan-mediated vasocontractile response was antagonized by SB216641 with an apparent pKb value of 8.6, which was consistent with its affinity for 5-HT(1B) receptor. Antagonism by BRL15572 was weak and calculated apparent pKb (6.0) value was consistent with its affinity for 5-HT(1B) subtype (but not for 5-HT(1D) subtype). This result indicates insignificant or no involvement of 5-HT(1D) receptor in the vasocontractile response. 4. The vasocontractile response induced by sumatriptan was highly sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment of CCA. Nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker, also potently antagonized vasocontractile response induced by sumatriptan. 5. 5-HT, but not sumatriptan, stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation in CCA. 6. These results indicate that stimulation of 5-HT(1B) subtype activate a pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive G protein (Go/Gi) and mediate vasocontraction, in which L-type voltage dependent calcium channels are involved.
12023318	Targeting leukocyte MMPs and transmigration: minocycline as a potential therapy for multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis is characterized by the infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS. As matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) facilitate the passage of leukocytes across matrix barriers, we tested the hypothesis that targeting MMPs could attenuate neuro-inflammation. We report that minocycline, a widely used generic drug with a good safety record, inhibited MMP activity, reduced production of MMP-9 and decreased the transmigration of T lymphocytes across a fibronectin matrix barrier. In addition, minocycline was efficacious against both mild and severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. When severe EAE was produced, minocycline pre-treatment delayed the course of the disease: when maximal disease activity occurred in vehicle-treated EAE mice, minocycline animals were relatively normal and had minimal signs of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. When tested in mice afflicted with mild EAE, minocycline attenuated the clinical severity of disease throughout the course of treatment. These results indicate that minocycline may constitute a safe and inexpensive therapy for multiple sclerosis.
12023506	Interaction of human organic anion transporters 2 and 4 with organic anion transport inhibitors.	The organic anion transport system is involved in the tubular excretion and reabsorption of various drugs and substances. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of various organic anion transport inhibitors on renal organic anion transport using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human organic anion transporter 2 (hOAT2) and hOAT4. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hOAT2 is localized to the basolateral side of the proximal tubule in the kidney. hOAT2 mediated a time- and concentration-dependent increase in prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) uptake. The organic anion transport inhibitors used for this study were probenecid, 8-(noradamantan-3-yl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine (KW-3902), betamipron, and cilastatin. Probenecid, but not KW-3902, betamipron, and cilastatin, significantly inhibited hOAT2-mediated PGF(2alpha) uptake. In contrast, probenecid, KW-3902, and betamipron, but not cilastatin, inhibited hOAT4-mediated estrone sulfate (ES) uptake. Kinetic analyses revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The K(i) value of probenecid for hOAT2 was 766 microM, whereas those of probenecid, KW-3902, and betamipron for hOAT4 were 54.9, 20.7, and 502 microM, respectively. These results suggest that probenecid, KW-3902, and betamipron could inhibit hOAT4-mediated ES uptake in vitro, whereas probenecid alone could inhibit the hOAT2-mediated PGF(2alpha) uptake. Comparing the K(i) values with the therapeutically relevant concentrations of unbound inhibitors in the plasma, probenecid alone was predicted to inhibit hOAT4-mediated organic anion transport in vivo.
12023686	Differences in AT2 -receptor stimulation between AT1 -receptor blockers valsartan and losartan quantified by renal interstitial fluid cGMP.	Angiotensin II-receptor blockers are an established class of antihypertensive agents, but the differences between individual members of the class are largely unknown. The present study employed an animal model to demonstrate angiotensin II-receptor blocker-specific effects and to quantify these differences by comparing two common agents, losartan and valsartan.
12034032	Mechanisms for regulation of cellular responsiveness to human IFN-beta1a.	Interferons (IFNs) are potent, pleiotropic cytokines, and therefore it is likely that the cell has mechanisms to modulate IFN activity in response to excessive or prolonged IFN exposure. To investigate this question, Jurkat T cells were exposed to IFN-beta1a in vitro. The effect of dose and frequency of IFN treatment on receptor expression, the signal transduction pathway, and biologic activity was examined. Results demonstrate that at even modest doses of IFN (60 IU/ml), cell surface expression of the IFN receptor subunit, IFNAR-1, decreased significantly, and the cells were unresponsive to further IFN treatment. More interestingly, after an initial treatment with very low concentrations of IFN (<10 IU/ml), even when receptor levels remained normal and phosphorylation of signaling molecules occurred, cells were still refractory to further IFN treatment. After withdrawal of IFN, full cellular responsiveness was a progressive but surprisingly slow process. Cells retreated 2 days or 4 days after the initial IFN treatment were still refractory to even high doses (500 IU/ml) of IFN. Cells retreated 1 week after the initial IFN treatment were fully responsive. High levels of Stat1 and Stat2 correlated with the block in transcriptional activation of IFN-dependent genes and may be a mechanism by which cells can downmodulate an IFN response. Similar results were obtained when fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were treated with IFN and expression of the endogenous IFN-dependent gene, MxA, was examined. Cell surface levels of IFNAR-1 decreased and Stat1 levels increased after IFN-beta treatment, and retreatment with IFN resulted in an attenuated induction of Mx protein expression. In the context of using IFNs as therapeutic agents in the treatment of human disease, our data suggest that increasing the amount or frequency of IFN administration may not yield desired biologic effects. Thus, issues concerning the dosage and the frequency of IFN-beta administration deserve careful consideration.
12055598	COX-1 and 2, intestinal integrity, and pathogenesis of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy in mice.	The pathogenesis of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy is controversial, but it is thought that cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition is of pivotal importance. We compared small intestinal function and morphology in untreated wild-type, COX-1- and COX-2-deficient mice and the effect of indomethacin, selective COX-1 (SC-560), and COX-2 (celecoxib) inhibition.
12057839	An anti-Parkinson's disease drug, N-propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan (rasagiline), enhances expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells.	N-Propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan (rasagiline) is now under phase III clinical trials for Parkinson's disease (PD), and it rescues dopamine neurons from cell death in animal and cellular models of PD. Recently, we proved that rasagiline protected dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells against apoptosis induced by a dopaminergic neurotoxin, N-methyl(R)salsolinol, and the mechanism was clarified to be due to suppression of death signal transduction in mitochondria. In this paper, the effects of rasagiline on the levels of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene family were studied. Rasagiline increased the levels of bcl-2 and bcl-x(l) mRNA at 100-10 nM and 100-10 pM, but not the level of pro-apoptotic bax mRNA. Enhanced expression of bcl-2 family indicates the ability of rasagiline to adjust the apoptotic threshold and protect degenerating neurons in PD.
12063084	The antipsychotic aripiprazole is a potent, partial agonist at the human 5-HT1A receptor.	Aripiprazole, 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone, a novel antipsychotic with partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 receptors, bound with high affinity to recombinant human 5-HT(1A) receptors (h5-HT(1A)) in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes and displayed potent, partial agonism at 5-HT(1A) receptors in a guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate ([(35)S]GTP gamma S)-binding assay that was blocked completely by a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. An interaction with 5-HT(1A) receptors may contribute to the overall efficacy of aripiprazole against symptoms of schizophrenia, including anxiety, depression, cognitive and negative symptoms, and to its favorable side-effect profile. Combined with previous studies demonstrating the potent partial agonism of aripiprazole at dopamine D2 receptors, this study suggests aripiprazole is the first dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer.
12063169	Role of human organic anion transporter 4 in the transport of ochratoxin A.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of ochratoxin A (OTA) transport by multispecific human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4) using mouse proximal tubule cells stably transfected with hOAT4 (S(2) hOAT4). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hOAT4 protein was localized to the apical side of the proximal tubule. S(2) hOAT4 expressed hOAT4 protein in the apical side as well as basolateral side and the cells were cultured on the plastic dish for experiments. S(2) hOAT4 exhibited a time- and concentration-dependent, and a saturable increase in OTA uptake, with an apparent K(m) value of 22.9+/-2.44 microM. The OTA uptakes were inhibited by several substrates for the OATs. Probenecid, piroxicam, octanoate and citrinin inhibited OTA uptake by hOAT4 in a competitive manner (K(i)=44.4-336.4 microM), with the following order of potency: probenecid > piroxicam > octanoate >citrinin. The efflux of OTA by S(2) hOAT4 was higher than that by mock. Addition of OTA resulted in slight decrease in viability of S(2) hOAT4 compared with mock. These results indicate that hOAT4 mediates the high-affinity transport of OTA on the apical side of the proximal tubule, whereas the transport characteristics of OTA are distinct from those by basolateral OATs.
12065733	Blockade of human cardiac potassium channel human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) by macrolide antibiotics.	Several macrolides have been reported to cause QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. To clarify the underlying ionic mechanisms, we examined the effects of six macrolides on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG)-encoded potassium current stably expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. All six drugs showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the current with the following IC(50) values: clarithromycin, 32.9 microM; roxithromycin, 36.5 microM; erythromycin, 72.2 microM; josamycin, 102.4 microM; erythromycylamine, 273.9 microM; and oleandomycin, 339.6 microM. A metabolite of erythromycin, des-methyl erythromycin, was also found to inhibit HERG current with an IC(50) of 147.1 microM. These findings imply that the blockade of HERG may be a common feature of macrolides and may contribute to the QT prolongation observed clinically with some of these compounds. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of HERG current by clarithromycin did not require activation of the channel and was both voltage- and time-dependent. The blocking time course could be described by a first-order reaction between the drug and the channel. Both binding and unbinding processes appeared to speed up as the membrane was more depolarized, indicating that the drug-channel interaction may be affected by electrostatic responses.
12079382	Structure of porphobilinogen synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with 5-fluorolevulinic acid suggests a double Schiff base mechanism.	All natural tetrapyrroles, including hemes, chlorophylls and vitamin B12, share porphobilinogen (PBG) as a common precursor. Porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) synthesizes PBG through the asymmetric condensation of two molecules of aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Crystal structures of PBGS from various sources confirm the presence of two distinct binding sites for each ALA molecule, termed A and P. We have solved the structure of the active-site variant D139N of the Mg2+-dependent PBGS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with the inhibitor 5-fluorolevulinic acid at high resolution. Uniquely, full occupancy of both substrate binding sites each by a single substrate-like molecule was observed. Both inhibitor molecules are covalently bound to two conserved, active-site lysine residues, Lys205 and Lys260, through Schiff bases. The active site now also contains a monovalent cation that may critically enhance enzymatic activity. Based on these structural data, we postulate a catalytic mechanism for P. aeruginosa PBGS initiated by a C-C bond formation between A and P-side ALA, followed by the formation of the intersubstrate Schiff base yielding the product PBG.
12086984	Effect of metabolic inhibition on glimepiride block of native and cloned cardiac sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels.	1. We have investigated the effects of the sulphonylurea, glimepiride, currently used to treat type 2 diabetes, on ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) currents of rat cardiac myocytes and on their cloned constituents Kir6.2 and SUR2A expressed in HEK 293 cells. 2. Glimepiride blocked pinacidil-activated whole-cell K(ATP) currents of cardiac myocytes with an IC(50) of 6.8 nM, comparable to the potency of glibenclamide in these cells. Glimepiride blocked K(ATP) channels formed by co-expression of Kir6.2/SUR2A subunits in HEK 293 cells in outside-out excised patches with a similar IC(50) of 6.2 nM. 3. Glimepiride was much less effective at blocking K(ATP) currents activated by either metabolic inhibition (MI) with CN(-) and iodoacetate or by the K(ATP) channel opener diazoxide in the presence of inhibitors of F(0)/F(1)-ATPase (oligomycin) and creatine kinase (DNFB). Thus 10 microM glimepiride blocked pinacidil-activated currents by >99%, MI-activated currents by 70% and diazoxide-activated currents by 82%. 4. In inside-out patches from HEK 293 cells expressing the cloned K(ATP) channel subunits Kir6.2/SUR2A, increasing the concentration of ADP (1 - 100 microM), in the presence of 100 nM glimepiride, lead to significant increases in Kir6.2/SUR2A channel activity. However, over the range tested, ADP did not affect cloned K(ATP) channel activity in the presence of 100 nM glibenclamide. These results are consistent with the suggestion that ADP reduces glimepiride block of K(ATP) channels. 5. Our results show that glimepiride is a potent blocker of native cardiac K(ATP) channels activated by pinacidil and blocks cloned Kir6.2/SUR2A channels activated by ATP depletion with similar potency. However, glimepiride is much less effective when K(ATP) channels are activated by MI and this may reflect a reduction in glimepiride block by increased intracellular ADP.
12097269	Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, induces apoptosis in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP through an androgen-independent pathway.	Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist that has been shown to prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer in women. Because the prostate contains a high level of ER-beta, the present study investigated the effect of raloxifene in the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Previously, it has been demonstrated that LNCaP cells express ER-beta but not ER-alpha and that tamoxifene induces apoptosis in these cells. After treatment with raloxifene, a dramatic increase in cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner (10(-9) to 10(-6) M range). Using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling apoptotic assay, we demonstrated that the nuclear fragmentation was due to apoptosis. The dramatic change in cellular morphology after treatment with raloxifene was no longer observed when cells were pretreated with a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, and a specific caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK. Furthermore, immunoblot demonstrated an activation of caspase-9 in LNCaP cells. Because LNCaP cells contain a mutated androgen receptor that allows cellular proliferation in the presence of antiandrogens, prostate-specific antigen assay and transfection with a reporter construct containing luciferase gene under the control of androgen response element (pARE) were carried out. The results demonstrated that raloxifene does not significantly alter androgen receptor activity in LNCaP cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that raloxifene, a selective ER modulator, induces apoptosis in the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP through an androgen-independent pathway.
12104042	Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib inhibits promotion of mammary tumorigenesis in rats fed a high fat diet rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	The objective of this investigation was to determine whether celecoxib, a highly specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inhibits the promotion phase of mammary tumorigenesis in rats fed a high fat diet rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that is known to induce COX-2 expression. Sixty female Sprague-Dawley rats were initially maintained on an AIN-93G diet. At 50 days of age they received a single i.p. injection of methylnitrosourea (MNU). One week later, all rats were switched to a modified AIN-93G diet containing 18% safflower oil plus 3% soybean oil. Half of the rats also began receiving 1500 ppm celecoxib in the diet and the control and experimental diets were continued for a further 23 weeks. Celecoxib significantly decreased both the final tumor incidence (63.3% in the celecoxib group versus 82.2% in the control group, P<0.05) and tumor multiplicity (0.9+/-0.2 tumors/rat in the celecoxib group versus 2.3+/-0.3 tumors/rat in the control group, P<0.05). At the termination of the experiment, body weights were significantly lower in the celecoxib group compared to controls (330.6+/-6.1 versus 401.5+/-10.9 g respectively, P<0.05) although there was no evidence of toxicity and food intakes were not different for the two groups. Fasting serum triglycerides and abdominal adipose tissue accumulation were lower in the celecoxib group compared to controls (49.3+/-4.4 versus 82.8+/-12.6 mg/dL, P<0.05, and 7.2+/-0.3 versus 11.3+/-0.4% of body weight, P<0.01, respectively). These results show that administration of celecoxib to rats in a high fat diet rich in n-6 PUFAs suppresses the promotion of mammary tumorigenesis induced by MNU. This inhibition may be due to the effects of celecoxib on lipid metabolism as well as COX-2.
12107644	Combined administration of oxalic acid, succimer and its analogue for the reversal of gallium arsenide-induced oxidative stress in rats.	Gallium arsenide (GaAs), a group III-VA intermetallic semiconductor, possesses superior electronic and optical properties and has a wide application in the electronics industry. Exposure to GaAs in the semiconductor industry is a potential occupational hazard because cleaning and slicing GaAs ingots to yield the desired wafer could generate GaAs particles. The ability of GaAs to induce oxidative stress has not yet been reported. The present study reports the role of oxidative stress in GaAs-induced haematological and liver disorders and its possible reversal overturn by administration of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and one of its analogue, monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA), either individually or in combination with oxalic acid. While DMSA and MiADMSA are potential arsenic chelators, oxalic acid is reported to be an effective gallium chelator. Male rats were exposed to 10 mg/kg GaAs orally, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. GaAs exposure was then stopped and rats were given a 0.5 mmol/kg dose of succimers (DMSA or MiADMSA), oxalic acid or a combination of the two, intraperitoneally once daily for 5 consecutive days. We found a significant fall in blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity and blood glutathione (GSH) level, and an increased urinary excretion of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and an increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in erythrocytes of rats exposed to GaAs. Hepatic GSH levels decreased, whereas there was an increase in GSSG and MDA levels. The results suggest a role of oxidative stress in GaAs-induced haematological and hepatic damage. Administration of DMSA and MiADMSA produced effective recovery in most of the above variables. However, a greater effectiveness of the chelation treatment (i.e. removal of both gallium and arsenic from body organs) could be achieved by combined administration of succimer (DMSA) with oxalic acid since, after MiADMSA administration, a marked loss of essential metals (copper and zinc) is of concern.
12110513	Role of prostanoids in regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by salt intake.	We investigated the effect of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity on the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by salt intake. Therefore, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to different salt diets [0.02, 0.6, and 8% NaCl (wt/wt)] and treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (10 mg x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) or with ketorolac at a dose selective for COX-1 inhibition (2 mg x kg body wt(-1) x day(-1)) for 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. Rofecoxib and ketorolac caused a similar reduction of renocortical PGE2 formation with a low-salt diet. Rofecoxib did not change plasma renin activity or renocortical renin mRNA abundance with any of the diets but clearly lowered plasma aldosterone concentration. In contrast, ketorolac delayed the increase in plasma renin activity and of renin mRNA in response to low salt intake but did not change plasma aldosterone concentration. Prolonged treatment with rofecoxib but not with ketorolac caused an upregulation of COX-2 expression while COX-1 mRNA abundance remained unchanged. These findings suggest that COX-1-derived, but not COX-2-derived, prostanoids are of relevance for the regulation of the renin system by salt intake.
12111824	Gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (BGT-1) expressed in human astrocytoma U373 MG cells: pharmacological and molecular characterization and phorbol ester-induced inhibition.	The properties of a transport system specific for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) expressed in human U373 MG astrocytoma cells were examined. The uptake of [(3)H]GABA was dependent on both extracellular Na(+) and Cl(-) ions and was inhibited by (+/-)-nipecotic acid, guvacine, and beta-alanine, with a pharmacological profile corresponding to that reported for the human homologue of the GABA/betaine transporter (BGT-1). Accordingly, [(3)H]GABA uptake was also inhibited by betaine, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of total RNA from U373 MG cells with specific BGT-1 primers resulted in the amplification of a 440 bp fragment that was further characterized by restriction analysis and sequencing. In addition, Western blot analysis with anti-BGT-1 antiserum revealed the presence of a characteristic 60 kDa band. The primary structure of the human BGT-1 protein predicts two putative phosphorylation sites for the Ca(2+)/diacylglicerol-dependent protein kinase (PKC), and treatment of U373 MG cells with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA) led to a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in [(3)H]GABA uptake. The maximal effect was detected at 2 hr of incubation, to disappear after 4 hr. TPA-induced reduction in [(3)H]GABA uptake was reversed by preincubation with staurosporine. Taken together, these results indicate that U373 MG cells express a GABA transporter of the BGT-1 subtype whose function is regulated by phosphorylation events through PKC.
12130730	Characterization of methotrexate transport and its drug interactions with human organic anion transporters.	Life-threatening drug interactions are known to occur between methotrexate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), probenecid, and penicillin G. The purpose of this study was to characterize methotrexate transport, as well as to determine the site and the mechanism of drug interactions in the proximal tubule. Mouse proximal tubule cells stably expressing basolateral human organic anion transporters (hOAT1 and hOAT3) and apical hOAT (hOAT4) were established. The K(m) values for hOAT1-, hOAT3-, and hOAT4-mediated methotrexate uptake were 553.8 microM, 21.1 microM, and 17.8 microM, respectively. NSAIDs (salicylate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, phenylbutazone, piroxicam, and indomethacin), probenecid, and penicillin G dose dependently inhibited methotrexate uptake mediated by hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4. Kinetic analysis of inhibitory effects of these drugs on hOAT3-mediated methotrexate uptake revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The K(i) values for the effects of salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid on hOAT3-mediated methotrexate uptake were comparable with therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations of unbound drugs. In addition, in the presence of human serum albumin, the K(i) values were comparable with therapeutically relevant total plasma concentrations of drugs. In conclusion, these results suggest that methotrexate is taken up via hOAT3 and hOAT1 at the basolateral side of the proximal tubule and effluxed or taken up at the apical side via hOAT4. In addition, hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4 are the sites of drug interactions between methotrexate and NSAIDs, probenecid, and penicillin G. Furthermore, it was predicted that hOAT3 is the site of drug interactions between methotrexate and salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and probenecid in vivo.
12147264	Rat liver acyl-CoA synthetase 4 is a peripheral-membrane protein located in two distinct subcellular organelles, peroxisomes, and mitochondrial-associated membrane.	Obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes favor storage of fatty acids in triacylglycerol over oxidation. Recently, individual acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) isoforms have been implicated in the channeling of fatty acids either toward lipid synthesis or toward oxidation. Although ACS1 had been localized to three different subcellular regions in rat liver, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, the study had used an antibody raised against the full-length ACS1 protein which cross-reacts with other isoforms, probably because all ACS family members contain highly conserved amino acid sequences. Therefore, we examined the subcellular location of ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 in rat liver to determine which isoform was present in peroxisomes, whether the ACSs were intrinsic membrane proteins, and which ACS isoforms were up-regulated by PPAR alpha ligands. Non-cross-reacting ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 peptide antibodies showed that ACS4 was the only ACS isoform present in peroxisomes isolated from livers of gemfibrozil-treated rats. ACS4 was also present in fractions identified as mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM). ACS1 was present in endoplasmic reticulum fractions and ACS5 was present in mitochondrial fractions. Incubation with troglitazone, a specific inhibitor of ACS4, decreased ACS activity in the MAM fractions 30-45% and in the peroxisomal fractions about 30%. Because the signal for ACS4 protein in peroxisomes was so strong compared to the MAM fraction, we examined ACS4 mRNA abundance in livers of rats treated with the PPAR alpha agonist GW9578. Treatment with GW9578 increased ACS4 mRNA abundance 40% and ACS1 mRNA 25%. Although we had originally proposed that ACS4 is linked to triacylglycerol synthesis, it now appears that ACS4 may also be important in activating fatty acids destined for peroxisomal oxidation. We also determined that, unlike ACS1 and 5, ACS4 is not an intrinsic membrane protein. This suggests that ACS4 is probably targeted and linked to MAM and peroxisomes by interactions with other proteins.
12151556	Serotonin clearance in vivo is altered to a greater extent by antidepressant-induced downregulation of the serotonin transporter than by acute blockade of this transporter.	Serotonin uptake, mediated by the serotonin transporter (SERT), is blocked acutely by antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but such blockade does not correlate temporally with the onset of therapeutic improvement. Treatment with SSRIs for 21 d induced downregulation of the SERT (Benmansour et al., 1999). The time course of SERT downregulation as well as the time course for its recovery after cessation of treatment with the SSRI sertraline were investigated using tritiated cyanoimipramine to measure SERT binding sites. To determine if there was a temporal correlation between the time when sertraline induced downregulation of the SERT and when marked alteration in SERT function occurred, clearance of locally applied 5-HT into the CA3 region of hippocampus was achieved using in vivo electrochemistry. After 4 or 10 d treatment with sertraline, SERT binding sites decreased very little (15-30%), and the chronoamperometric signals for serotonin in sertraline-treated rats were comparable with ones obtained in control animals. By contrast, after 15 d of treatment, when SERT binding sites were markedly reduced by 80%, there was robust decrease in the clearance of 5-HT. Moreover, the functional consequences of SERT downregulation as measured by chronoamperometry were significantly greater than those seen after acute blockade of the SERT by SSRIs. SERT binding sites decreases are not a consequence of reduced SERT gene expression, as revealed by in situ hybridization measurements. SSRI-induced downregulation of the SERT may be a key component for the clinical response to SSRIs.
12166927	6alpha-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA), a potent and selective FXR agonist endowed with anticholestatic activity.	A series of 6alpha-alkyl-substituted analogues of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) were synthesized and evaluated as potential farnesoid X receptor (FXR) ligands. Among them, 6alpha-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA) was shown to be a very potent and selective FXR agonist (EC(50) = 99 nM) and to be endowed with anticholeretic activity in an in vivo rat model of cholestasis.
12167662	Identification of a dantrolene-binding sequence on the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor.	Dantrolene is a drug that suppresses intracellular Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in skeletal muscle and is used as a therapeutic agent in individuals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Although its precise mechanism of action has not been elucidated, we have identified the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-1400) of the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), the primary Ca(2+) release channel in SR, as a molecular target for dantrolene using the photoaffinity analog [(3)H]azidodantrolene. Here, we demonstrate that heterologously expressed RyR1 retains its capacity to be specifically labeled with [(3)H]azidodantrolene, indicating that muscle specific factors are not required for this ligand-receptor interaction. Synthetic domain peptides of RyR1 previously shown to affect RyR1 function in vitro and in vivo were exploited as potential drug binding site mimics and used in photoaffinity labeling experiments. Only DP1 and DP1-2s, peptides containing the amino acid sequence corresponding to RyR1 residues 590-609, were specifically labeled by [(3)H]azidodantrolene. A monoclonal anti-RyR1 antibody that recognizes RyR1 and its 1400-amino acid N-terminal fragment recognizes DP1 and DP1-2s in both Western blots and immunoprecipitation assays and specifically inhibits [(3)H]azidodantrolene photolabeling of RyR1 and its N-terminal fragment in SR. Our results indicate that synthetic domain peptides can mimic a native, ligand-binding conformation in vitro and that the dantrolene-binding site and the epitope for the monoclonal antibody on RyR1 are equivalent and composed of amino acids 590-609.
12172398	Influences of the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism on plasma HDL(2)-cholesterol response of abdominally obese men treated with gemfibrozil.	The effect of gemfibrozil is mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). The objective of this study was to determine whether the lipid response to gemfibrozil therapy is influenced by the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism.
12176129	The anti-malarial drug halofantrine and its metabolite N-desbutylhalofantrine block HERG potassium channels.	The antimalarial drug halofantrine has been associated with QT interval prolongation and with fatal and nonfatal arrhythmias in patients without known underlying cardiac abnormalities. A common target for QT interval-prolonging drugs is the human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG) which encodes the pore forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)).
12185406	Bupropion occupancy of the dopamine transporter is low during clinical treatment.	Bupropion is thought to treat major depression by blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) because bupropion appears to have a selective affinity for the DAT. The validity of this mechanism has been questioned because the affinity of bupropion for the DAT is quite low.
12196472	Differential interactions of nateglinide and repaglinide on the human beta-cell sulphonylurea receptor 1.	Repaglinide and nateglinide represent a new class of insulin secretagogues, structurally unrelated to sulphonylureas, that were developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The inhibitory effect of these drugs was investigated on recombinant wild-type and mutant Kir6.2/SUR1 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. Nateglinide and repaglinide dose-dependently inhibited whole-cell Kir6.2/SUR1 currents with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 800 and 21 nmol/l, respectively. Mutation of serine 1237 in SUR1 to tyrosine (S1237Y) abolished tolbutamide and nateglinide block, suggesting that these drugs share a common point of interaction on the SUR1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel. In contrast, repaglinide inhibition was unaffected by the S1237Y mutation (IC(50) = 23 nmol/l). Radioligand binding studies revealed a single high-affinity binding site for [(3)H]repaglinide on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing wild-type (equilibrium dissociation constant [K(D)] = 0.40 nmol/l) or mutant (K(D) = 0.31 nmol/l) Kir6.2/SUR1 channels. Nateglinide and tolbutamide displaced [(3)H]repaglinide binding to wild-type channels with IC(50) values of 0.7 and 26 micro mol/l, respectively, but produced <10% displacement of [(3)H]repaglinide bound to mutant channels. This is consistent with the idea that binding of nateglinide and tolbutamide, but not repaglinide, is abolished by the SUR1[S1237Y] mutation and that the binding site for repaglinide is not identical to that of nateglinde/tolbutamide. These results are discussed in terms of a conformational analysis of the drug molecules.
12209010	Position of aromatic residues in the S6 domain, not inactivation, dictates cisapride sensitivity of HERG and eag potassium channels.	Unintended block of HERG K+ channels is a side effect of many common medications and is the most common cause of acquired long QT syndrome associated with increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. The molecular mechanism of high-affinity HERG block by structurally diverse compounds has been attributed to pi-stacking and cation-pi interactions of a drug (e.g., cisapride) with specific aromatic amino acid residues (Tyr-652 and Phe-656) in the S6 alpha-helical domain that face the central cavity of the channel. It also has been proposed that strong C-type inactivation of HERG facilitates or is the primary determinant of high-affinity drug binding. The structurally related, but noninactivating eag channel is insensitive to HERG blockers unless inactivation is induced by specific amino acid mutations [Ficker, E., Jarolimek, W. & Brown, A. M. (2001) Mol. Pharmacol. 60, 1343-1348]. Here we examine the relative importance of inactivation vs. positioning of S6 aromatic residues in determining sensitivity of HERG and eag channels to block by cisapride. The repositioning of Tyr-652 or Phe-656 along the S6 alpha-helical domain of HERG reduced sensitivity of channels to block by cisapride. Moreover, independent of inactivation, repositioning of the equivalent aromatic residues in Drosophila eag channels induced sensitivity to block by cisapride. These findings suggest that positioning of S6 aromatic residues relative to the central cavity of the channel, not inactivation per se determines drug block of HERG or eag channels.
12213055	Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships of mazindol analogues at the dopamine transporter.	A three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) study was performed on a series of mazindol analogues using the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) method with their corresponding binding affinities for the displacement of [(3)H]WIN 35 428 from rat caudate putamen tissue. The cross-validated CoMFA models were derived from a training set of 50 compounds, and the predictive ability of the resulting CoMFA models was evaluated against a test set of 21 compounds. A set of alignment rules was derived to superimpose these compounds onto a template structure, mazindol (1). These CoMFA models yielded significant cross-validated r(2)(cv) values. Inclusion of additional descriptors did not improve the significance of the CoMFA models; thus, steric and electrostatic fields are the relevant descriptors for these compounds. The best QSAR model was selected on the basis of the predictive ability of the activity on the external test set of compounds. The analysis of coefficient contour maps provided further insight into the binding interactions of mazindol analogues with the DAT. The aromatic rings C and D are involved in hydrophobic interactions in which ring D may bind in a large hydrophobic groove. The relative orientation of these two rings is also important for high binding affinity to the DAT.
12222762	Agonist activity of bimatoprost, travoprost, latanoprost, unoprostone isopropyl ester and other prostaglandin analogs at the cloned human ciliary body FP prostaglandin receptor.	We have determined the agonist activity of a number of natural prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogs at the FP prostaglandin receptor cloned from a human ciliary body cDNA library using phosphoinositide (PI) turnover assays. Travoprost acid (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 0.6 nM) was the most potent agonist in these cells followed by bimatoprost free acid (17-phenyl-trinor PGF2alpha; EC50 = 5.8 +/- 2.6 nM), fluprostenol (EC50 = 6.1 +/- 1.5 nM), and latanoprost free acid (PHXA85; EC50 = 54.6 +/- 12.4 nM) which was 17-fold weaker (p < 0.001) than travoprost acid. Unoprostone and S-1033 were significantly (p < 0.001) weaker than travoprost acid. The amide prodrug, bimatoprost (EC50 = 694 +/- 293 nM), activated this FP receptor with an intermediate potency. The isopropyl ester prodrugs, travoprost (EC50 = 42.3 +/- 6.7 nM), latanoprost (EC50 = 126 +/- 347 nM) and unoprostone isopropyl ester (EC50 = 9,100 +/- 2,870 nM), also exhibited FP agonist activity. However, other compounds such as PGI2, bradykinin, histamine, and serotonin were inactive. The agonist activities of bimatoprost, unoprostone (UF-021), fluprostenol and acids of travoprost and latanoprost were antagonized by AL-8810 (11beta-fluoro- 15-epi-15-indanyl-PGF2alpha), an FP-receptor-selective antagonist (Ki = 1.0 - 2.1 microM; n = 3). These studies have demonstrated, for the first time, agonist activities of the currently known and marketed ocular hypotensive prostaglandin analogs at the cloned human ciliary body FP prostaglandin receptor.
12233819	Effects of sarpogrelate, a novel 5-HT2 antagonist, on 5-HT-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations in porcine coronary artery.	The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of sarpogrelate, a 5-HT2 antagonist, on 5-HT-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated porcine coronary artery preincubated with ketanserin (3 x 10(-6) M) and precontracted by U 46619 (5 x 10(-9) M) and compare its effects with other 5-HT2 antagonists such as ritanserin and cyproheptadine. The investigation showed that sarpogrelate (10(-7)-10(-5) M) had a weak antagonistic effect on 5-HT-induced relaxation and its effect was weaker than that of ritanserin (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and cyproheptadine (10(-8)-10(-6) M). The rank order of the antagonistic effects was: ritanserin > cyproheptadine > sarpogrelate. The study also showed that both sarpogrelate and ritanserin had no inhibitory effect on bradykinin-induced relaxation. In our previous study, we investigated the binding affinity of sarpogrelate, ritanserin and cyproheptadine to the 5-HT2A-receptor in rabbit cerebral cortex membranes and the pKi values found were 7.22, 8.98 and 7.54, respectively (M. Rashid et al., Jpn J Pharmacol 87, 189-194, 2001). Rank order of the calculated ratio of concentration of pA2 or pD'2 vs Ki was: sarpogrelate > ritanserin > cyproheptadine. Thus, these findings suggest that sarpogrelate has the lowest antagonistic effect on 5-HT-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation and the highest selectivity towards 5-HT2A receptor and might also be the safest drug with respect to its clinical implications in comparison with ritanserin and cyproheptadine.
12401318	Chemical responsiveness and histochemical phenotype of electrophysiologically classified cells of the adult rat dorsal root ganglion.	Whole cell patch recordings were obtained from medium diameter (35-45 microm) dorsal root ganglion neurons. Using electrophysiological parameters, we were able to subclassify acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion cells into three uniform (types 5, 6 and 9) and one mixed class (type 8) of neurons. All subtypes (types 5, 6, 8 and 9) had broad action potentials (7.0+/-0.2, 5.2+/-0.4, 7.3+/-0.5 and 6.0+/-0.4 ms) and exceptionally long afterhyperpolarizations (112+/-9, 178+/-19, 124+/-31 and 204+/-33 ms). Long afterhyperpolarizations have been linked to mechanically insensitive (silent) nociceptors by other laboratories [Djouhri et al., J. Physiol. 513 (1998) 857-872]. Chemosensitivity varied among cell classes. Cell types 5, 8 and 9 were capsaicin sensitive (45+/-13, 87+/-30 and 28+/-13 pA/pF; 5 microM) groups, while the type 6 cell was capsaicin insensitive. All cell types expressed ASIC-like (acid sensing ion channel) amiloride sensitive, proton-activated currents with a threshold of pH 6.8 and a peak near pH 5.0. All medium sized cells were sensitive to ATP (50 microM) and exhibited the 'mixed' form of ATP-gated current [Burgard et al., J. Neurophysiol. 82 (1999) 1590-1598; Grubb and Evans, Eur. J. Neurosci. 11 (1999) 149-154]. Immunohistochemistry performed on individual cells indicated the expression of both P2X(1) and P2X(3) subunits. Electrophysiologically defined classes were histochemically uniform. All types were examined for the presence of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and binding of isolectin B4 (IB4). All subtypes expressed CGRP immunoreactivity. Types 5 and 8 co-expressed SP and CGRP immunoreactivity and also bound IB4. Subtypes 6 and 9 were positive for neurofilament m. It is likely that these cells represent major classes of myelinated and unmyelinated peptide expressing nociceptors.
12402511	Analysis of moricizine block of sodium current in isolated guinea-pig atrial myocytes. Atrioventricular difference of moricizine block.	The effects of moricizine on Na+ channel currents (INa) were investigated in guinea-pig atrial myocytes and its effects on INa in ventricular myocytes and on cloned hH1 current were compared using the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. Moricizine induced the tonic block of INa with the apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) of 6.3 microM at -100 mV and 99.3 microM at -140 mV. Moricizine at 30 microM shifted the h infinity curve to the hyperpolarizing direction by 8.6 +/- 2.4 mV. Moricizine also produced the phasic block of INa, which was enhanced with the increase in the duration of train pulses, and was more prominent with a holding potential (HP) of -100 mV than with an HP of -140 mV. The onset block of INa induced by moricizine during depolarization to -20 mV was continuously increased with increasing the pulse duration, and was enhanced at the less negative HP. The slower component of recovery of the moricizine-induced INa block was relatively slow, with a time constant of 4.2 +/- 2.0 s at -100 mV and 3.0 +/- 1.2 s at -140 mV. Since moricizine induced the tonic block of ventricular INa with Kd,app of 3.1 +/- 0.8 microM at HP = -100 mV and 30.2 +/- 6.8 microM at HP = -140 mV, and cloned hH1 with Kd,app of 3.0 +/- 0.5 microM at HP = -100 mV and 22.0 +/- 3.2 microM at HP = -140 mV, respectively, either ventricular INa or cloned hH1 had significantly higher sensitivity to moricizine than atrial INa. The h infinity curve of ventricular INa was shifted by 10.5 +/- 3.5 mV by 3 microM moricizine and that of hH1 was shifted by 5.0 +/- 2.3 mV by 30 microM moricizine. From the modulated receptor theory, we have estimated the dissociation constants for the resting and inactivated state to be 99.3 and 1.2 microM in atrial myocytes, 30 and 0.17 microM in ventricular myocytes, and 22 and 0.2 microM in cloned hH1, respectively. We conclude that moricizine has a higher affinity for the inactivated Na+ channel than for the resting state channel in atrial myocytes, and moricizine showed the significant atrioventricular difference of moricizine block on INa. Moricizine would exert an antiarrhythmic action on atrial myocytes, as well as on ventricular myocytes, by blocking Na+ channels with a high affinity to the inactivated state and a slow dissociation kinetics.
12407077	Probing an open CFTR pore with organic anion blockers.	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that conducts Cl- current. We explored the CFTR pore by studying voltage-dependent blockade of the channel by two organic anions: glibenclamide and isethionate. To simplify the kinetic analysis, a CFTR mutant, K1250A-CFTR, was used because this mutant channel, once opened, can remain open for minutes. Dose-response relationships of both blockers follow a simple Michaelis-Menten function with K(d) values that differ by three orders of magnitude. Glibenclamide blocks CFTR from the intracellular side of the membrane with slow kinetics. Both the on and off rates of glibenclamide block are voltage dependent. Removing external Cl- increases affinity of glibenclamide due to a decrease of the off rate and an increase of the on rate, suggesting the presence of a Cl- binding site external to the glibenclamide binding site. Isethionate blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side with fast kinetics, but has no measurable effect when applied extracellularly. Increasing the internal Cl- concentration reduces isethionate block without affecting its voltage dependence, suggesting that Cl- and isethionate compete for a binding site in the pore. The voltage dependence and external Cl- concentration dependence of isethionate block are nearly identical to those of glibenclamide block, suggesting that these two blockers may bind to a common binding site, an idea further supported by kinetic studies of blocking with glibenclamide/isethionate mixtures. By comparing the physical and chemical natures of these two blockers, we propose that CFTR channel has an asymmetric pore with a wide internal entrance and a deeply embedded blocker binding site where local charges as well as hydrophobic components determine the affinity of the blockers.
12416030	Severe folate restriction results in depletion of and alteration in the composition of the intracellular folate pool, moderate sensitization to methotrexate and trimetrexate, upregulation of endogenous DHFR activity, and overexpression of metallothionein II and folate receptor alpha that, upon folate repletion, confer drug resistance to CHL cells.	DC-3F/FA3 cells (FA3) were derived from antifolate-sensitive CHL cells by selection for growth in folate-free media containing 15 pM [6S]-5CHOFH4. These cells undergo a 30-fold decrease in intracellular folates, overexpress folate receptor alpha (FR alpha) and metallothionein II, and display increased sensitivity to the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) targeted anti-folates methotrexate (MTX) and trimetrexate (TMTX), which can be attributed primarily to the folate pool status. Upon folate repletion by growth in 15 nM [6S]-5CHOFH4, they display a 5- and 10-fold increase in resistance to both drugs, respectively, even though folate pools are restored by only 43%. Enforced overexpression of FR alpha in transfectants cultured in nanomolar folate did not confer resistance to MTX but did support a modest 2-fold increase in resistance to TMTX. Enforced overexpression of MTII had a similar effect, but when both were overexpressed together no increase in resistance beyond that conferred by each one separately was noted, suggesting that both confer resistance to TMTX through a common downstream mechanism. Analysis of three independent low folate selected clones, FA3, FA7, and FA14, showed that each had a 5- to 6-fold increase in DHFR activity accompanied by a similar increase in DHFR protein level. However, no differences were detected in the DHFR gene copy number or in the steady-state amount of DHFR mRNA, suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism was responsible for the increase in DHFR expression.
12421478	Inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 4A expressed in yeast cell GL62 by theophylline, rolipram, and acetamide-45.	To study the inductive expression of human phosphodiesterase 4A (hPDE4A) in yeast cell GL62 and investigate the inhibitory effects of theophylline, rolipram, and acetamide-45 on PDE4A activity of the expressed product in yeast cell GL62.
12446609	In altering the release of glucocorticoids, ketorolac exacerbates the effects of systemic immune stimuli on expression of proinflammatory genes in the brain.	Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for their antiinflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties. The molecular basis for the therapeutic action of NSAIDs is believed to be in their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and thereby blocking the production of prostaglandins. Emerging evidence now suggests that NSAIDs can exert their pharmacological effects through other mechanisms. This study investigated the influence of a nonselective COX-inhibitor ketorolac on IL-1beta- and TNFalpha-induced expression of proinflammatory genes in the brain. Systemic injection of both cytokines caused a rapid and transient transcriptional activation of COX-2 gene within the cerebral microvasculature, which was significantly enhanced by ketorolac. Expression of genes encoding the index of nuclear factor kappaB activity and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was also increased by the NSAID. We speculated here that such effect was indirectly mediated via an altered secretion of plasma glucocorticoids because ketorolac is a potent inhibitor of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during systemic inflammation. As expected, pretreatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 exacerbated the influence of systemic immune stimuli on proinflammatory signaling. In contrast, exogenous corticosterone abolished the effects of ketorolac on IL-1beta-induced COX-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene expression in the cerebral endothelium. This drug plays therefore a paradoxical role in its ability to inhibit the circulating levels of glucocorticoids that are essential inhibitory feedback on the proinflammatory signal transduction pathways and gene transcription. In altering the production of key prostaglandins that are involved in the control of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, ketorolac may have proinflammatory properties in the central nervous system during systemic immune stimuli.
12460705	Prolonged treatment with the AT1 receptor blocker, valsartan, increases small and large artery compliance in uncomplicated essential hypertension.	Decreased arterial compliance (AC) is considered an early marker of vascular wall damage. Hypertension gradually decreases arterial compliance. We studied whether treatment with the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) antagonist valsartan will affect AC in patients with essential hypertension (EH).
12464448	Evaluation of antidepressant-related behavioral responses in mice lacking the serotonin transporter.	Inhibition of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a principal initial target of many antidepressants. However, the contribution of the 5-HTT to their therapeutic efficacy is incompletely understood. We utilized a targeted gene mutation approach to examine the role of the 5-HTT in the behavioral actions of antidepressants. The 5-HTT mutation was bred onto two separate genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J and 129S6. On a preliminary screen for gross physical, neurological and behavioral functions, all measures were normal with the exception that 5-HTT -/- mice on the C57BL/6J background showed increased body weight and poor rotarod performance, and 5-HTT -/- mice on the 129S6 background showed reduced neuromuscular strength. On the tail suspension test, 5-HTT -/- mice on the 129S6 background showed a baseline antidepressant-like reduction in immobility. In contrast, the same mice showed increased immobility in the forced swim test, possibly due to compromised neuromuscular strength. 5-HTT -/- mice on the C57BL/6J background showed no baseline antidepressant-related phenotype on either test. The behavioral effects of three antidepressants were tested in 5-HTT mutant mice (C57BL/6J background) in the tail suspension test. The anti-immobility effects of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (30 mg/kg), were abolished in 5-HTT -/- mice, confirming that the 5-HTT gene is required for the behavioral effects of fluoxetine. In contrast, 5-HTT-/- mice retained sensitivity to the anti-immobility effects of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, desipramine (20 mg/kg), and the mixed serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, imipramine (25 mg/kg). 5-HTT knockout mice provide a valuable tool for delineating the neuropsychopharmacological actions of antidepressants.
12477710	Migraine can be induced by sildenafil without changes in middle cerebral artery diameter.	Migraine is considered a neurovascular disease involving dilatation of cerebral arteries. Nitric oxide (NO) donors induce dilatation of cerebral and extracranial arteries and migraine, but NO has several mechanisms of action in addition to its cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated vasodilatation. We examined whether sildenafil (Viagra), a selective inhibitor of cGMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which acts exclusively by increasing cGMP, can induce migraine and dilatation of cerebral arteries. We included 12 patients with migraine without aura in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, in which placebo or sildenafil 100 mg was administered orally on two separate days. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(mca)) was recorded by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and regional cerebral blood flow in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (rCBF(mca)) was measured using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and xenon 133 inhalation. Radial and temporal artery diameters were studied using high-frequency ultrasonography. Headache response, tenderness of pericranial muscles, blood pressure and heart rate were measured repeatedly. We found that migraine attack was induced by sildenafil in 10 of 12 migraine patients and by placebo in two of 12 patients (P = 0.01). V(mca) (P = 0.1) and rCBF(mca) (P = 0.93) remained unchanged after sildenafil. Temporal (P = 0.47) and radial (P = 0.87) artery diameter and pericranial tenderness (P = 0.16) were unaffected by sildenafil. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were unchanged but heart rate increased from a mean of 62 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 3 beats/min (P = 0.01) after sildenafil. Our results demonstrate that migraine may be induced via a cGMP-dependent mechanism, and we show for the first time that this occurs without initial dilatation of the middle cerebral artery. We propose that triggering mechanisms may reside within the perivascular sensory nerve terminals or the brainstem. However, other sites of action may also be possible and future studies are needed to elucidate this. In the clinical use of sildenafil, patients who have migraine should be informed about the risk of migraine attacks.
12488248	Organic anion transporter 3 (Slc22a8) is a dicarboxylate exchanger indirectly coupled to the Na+ gradient.	Basolateral uptake of organic anions in renal proximal tubule cells is indirectly coupled to the Na(+) gradient through Na(+)-dicarboxylate cotransport and organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange. One member of the organic anion transporter (OAT) family, Oat1, is expressed in the proximal tubule and is an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger. However, a second organic anion carrier, Oat3, is also highly expressed in the renal proximal tubule, but its mechanism is unclear. Thus we have assessed Oat3 function in Xenopus laevis oocytes and rat renal cortical slices. Probenecid-sensitive uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH, an Oat1 and Oat3 substrate) and estrone sulfate (ES, an Oat3 substrate) in rat Oat3-expressing oocytes was significantly trans-stimulated by preloading the oocytes with the dicarboxylate glutarate (GA). GA stimulation of ES transport by oocytes coexpressing rabbit Na(+)-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 and rat Oat3 was significantly inhibited when the preloading medium contained Li(+) or methylsuccinate (MS) or when Na(+) was absent. All these treatments inhibit the Na(+)-dicarboxylate cotransporter, but not rat Oat3. Li(+), MS, and Na(+) removal had no effect when applied during the ES uptake step, rather than during the GA preloading step. Concentrative ES uptake in rat renal cortical slices was also demonstrated to be probenecid and Na(+) sensitive. Accumulation of ES was stimulated by GA, and this stimulation was completely blocked by probenecid, Li(+), MS, taurocholate, and removal of Na(+). Thus Oat3 functions as an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that couples organic anion uptake indirectly to the Na(+) gradient.
12504781	In vitro effect of sanguinarine alkaloid on binding of [3H]candesartan to the human angiotensin AT1 receptor.	The type of interaction of 5-methyl-2,3,7,8-bis(methylenedioxy)benzo[c]phenanthridinium (sanguinarine), an alkaloid isolated from the root of Bocconia frutescens L., with the human angiotensin AT(1) receptor was evaluated in both intact cells and membrane binding of [3H](2-ethoxy-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazoline-7-carboxylic acid) ([3H]candesartan). The results indicate that the inhibition of [3H]candesartan binding by sanguinarine is independent of cell viability, since the alkaloid inhibited at a similar extent radioligand binding on both intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human angiotensin AT(1) receptor (hAT(1)) and their cell membranes (K(i)=0.14 and 1.10 microM, respectively). The unsuccessful recovery of [3H]candesartan binding after washing sanguinarine off the cells suggested a nearly irreversible or slow reversible interaction. Saturation binding studies showed a substantial reduction of the B(max) without affecting the K(d). In addition, the presence of 2-n-butyl-4chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole (losartan) could not prevent sanguinarine inhibition of [3H]candesartan binding neither. The present findings indicate that sanguinarine interacts with the receptor in a slow, nearly irreversible and noncompetitive manner.
12517791	Novel mutations of androgen receptor: a possible mechanism of bicalutamide withdrawal syndrome.	Most prostate cancers (PCs) become resistant to combined androgen blockade therapy with surgical or medical castration and antiandrogens after several years. Some of these refractory PCs regress after discontinuation of antiandrogen administration [antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AWS)]. Although the molecular mechanisms of the AWS are not fully understood because of the lack of suitable experimental models, one hypothesis of the mechanism is mutation of androgen receptor (AR). However, bicalutamide, which has become the most prevalent pure antiandrogen, does not work as an agonist for any mutant AR detected thus far in PC. To elucidate the mechanisms of the AWS, we established and characterized novel LNCaP cell sublines, LNCaP-cxDs, which were generated in vitro by culturing androgen-dependent LNCaP-FGC human PC cells in androgen-depleted medium with bicalutamide to mimic the combined androgen blockade therapy. LNCaP-FGC cells did not grow at first, but they started to grow after 6-13 weeks of culture. Bicalutamide stimulated LNCaP-cxD cell growth and increased prostate-specific antigen secretion from LNCaP-cxD cells both in vitro and in vivo. Sequencing of AR transcripts revealed that the AR in LNCaP-cxD cells harbors a novel mutation in codon 741, TGG (tryptophan) to TGT (cysteine; W741C), or in codon 741, TGG to TTG (leucine; W741L), in the ligand-binding domain. Transactivation assays showed that bicalutamide worked as an agonist for both W741C and W741L mutant ARs. Importantly, another antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide, worked as an antagonist for these mutant ARs. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that within only 6-13 weeks of in vitro exposure to bicalutamide, LNCaP-FGC cells, whose growth had initially been suppressed, came to use bicalutamide as an AR agonist via W741 AR mutation to survive. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that AR mutation is one possible mechanism of the AWS and suggest that flutamide might be effective as a second-line therapy for refractory PC previously treated with bicalutamide.
12522088	Butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase activity and quantal transmitter release at normal and acetylcholinesterase knockout mouse neuromuscular junctions.	1 The present study was performed to evaluate the presence and the physiological consequences of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition on isolated phrenic-hemidiaphragm preparations from normal mice expressing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE, and from AChE-knockout mice (AChE(-/-)) expressing only BChE. 2 Histochemical and enzymatic assays revealed abundance of AChE and BChE in normal mature neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). 3 In normal NMJs, in which release was reduced by low Ca(2+)/high Mg(2+) medium BChE inhibition with tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA) or bambuterol decreased ( approximately 50%) evoked quantal release, while inhibition of AChE with fasciculin-1, galanthamine (10, 20 micro M) or neostigmine (0.1-1 micro M) increased (50-80%) evoked quantal release. Inhibition of both AChE and BChE with galanthamine (80 micro M), neostigmine (3-10 micro M), O-ethylS-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl-methylphosphono-thioate (MTP) or phospholine decreased evoked transmitter release (20-50%). 4 In AChE(-/-) NMJs, iso-OMPA pre-treatment decreased evoked release. 5 Muscarinic toxin-3 decreased evoked release in both AChE(-/-) and normal NMJs treated with low concentrations of neostigmine, galanthamine or fasciculin-1, but had no effect in normal NMJs pretreated with iso-OMPA, bambuterol, MTP and phospholine. 6 In normal and AChE(-/-) NMJs pretreatment with iso-OMPA failed to affect the time course of miniature endplate potentials and full-sized endplate potentials. 7 Overall, our results suggest that inhibition or absence of AChE increases evoked quantal release by involving muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), while BChE inhibition decreases release through direct or indirect mechanisms not involving mAChRs. BChE apparently is not implicated in limiting the duration of acetylcholine action on postsynaptic receptors, but is involved in a presynaptic modulatory step of the release process.
12527923	A novel matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, FYK-1388 suppresses tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis by human fibrosarcoma cell line.	The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are likely to contribute to tumor cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Several MMP inhibitors have been developed, recently and their anti-tumor efficacy is being evaluated in clinical trials. FYK-1388 is a novel broad MMP inhibitor which blocks the activity of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -13 and -14 (MT-MMP-1). It is especially effective against MMP-2 and -9 more so than other MMP inhibitors such as Marimastat, Ro 32-3555 and D-2163. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of FYK-1388 using the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080. These cells produced MMP-2 and -9, which FYK-1388 inhibited at a dose of 10(-8) M. FYK-1388 at 0.2 mg/mouse/day significantly suppressed tumor growth when given by s.c. injection for 22 days, experimental lung metastasis after 5 days s.c. injection and also suppressed tumor-induced angiogenesis in the dorsal air sac assay after 7 days s.c. injection. In the MTT assay, FYK-1388 had no effect on the in vitro growth of HT-1080 cells. These results suggest that FYK-1388 possesses anti-tumor efficacy as a result of inhibiting angiogenesis through the suppression of MMP-2 and -9 activity.
12534640	Pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and inhibition of cyclooxygenases 1 and 2: no relationship to the CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism in humans.	The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 catalyses the 4'-hydroxylation of the nonsteroidal analgesic drug diclofenac in humans. We studied the influences of the known amino acid variants, CYP2C9*2 (Arg144Cys) and CYP2C9*3 (Ile359Leu), on diclofenac pharmacokinetics after a 50-mg oral dose of diclofenac in healthy volunteers. As a surrogate marker of diclofenac activity, the ex vivo formation of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2, which reflects COX-2 and COX-1 activity, was measured.
12538800	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of entacapone and tolcapone after acute and repeated administration: a comparative study in the rat.	Two catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, entacapone and tolcapone, were compared in the rat to elucidate the actual differences between their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after single and repeated administration. Their inhibitory potencies were also compared in vitro. After intravenous administration (3 mg/kg), the elimination half-life (t(1/2 beta)) of entacapone (0.8 h) was clearly shorter than that of tolcapone (2.9 h). The striatum/serum ratio of tolcapone was 3-fold higher than that of entacapone. After a single oral dose (10 mg/kg), both entacapone and tolcapone produced an equal maximal degree of COMT inhibition in peripheral tissues, but tolcapone inhibited striatal COMT more effectively than did entacapone. After the 7-day treatment (10 mg/kg twice daily), COMT activity had recovered to a level of 67 to 101% of control within 8 h after the last dose of entacapone. In tolcapone-treated animals, there was still extensive COMT inhibition present in peripheral tissues, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that attained after a single dose. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling revealed that a plateau of COMT inhibition near the maximal attainable inhibition was reached already by plasma concentrations below 2000 ng/ml, both with entacapone and tolcapone. Entacapone and tolcapone inhibited equally rat liver COMT in vitro with K(i) values of 10.7 and 10.0 nM, respectively. In conclusion, tolcapone has a longer duration of action and a better brain penetration than entacapone. The results also suggest that peripheral COMT is inhibited continuously when tolcapone is dosed at 12-h intervals, but this was not seen with entacapone.
12540520	Effects of the AT1-receptor antagonist eprosartan on the progression of left ventricular dysfunction in dogs with heart failure.	1. We examined the effects of eprosartan, an AT(1) receptor antagonist, on the progression of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and remodelling in dogs with heart failure (HF) produced by intracoronary microembolizations (LV ejection fraction, EF 30 to 40%). 2. Dogs were randomized to 3 months of oral therapy with low-dose eprosartan (600 mg once daily, n=8), high-dose eprosartan (1200 mg once daily, n=8), or placebo (n=8). 3. In the placebo group, LV end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV) volumes increased after 3 months (68+/-7 vs 82+/-9 ml, P<0.004, 43+/-1 vs 58+/-7 ml, P<0.003, respectively), and EF decreased (37+/-1 vs 29+/-1%, P<0.001). In dogs treated with low-dose eprosartan, EF, EDV, and ESV remained unchanged over the course of therapy, whereas in dogs treated with high-dose eprosartan, EF increased (38+/-1 vs 42+/-1%, P<0.004) and ESV decreased (41+/-1 vs 37+/-1 ml, P<0.006), Eprosartan also decreased interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. 4. We conclude that eprosartan prevents progressive LV dysfunction and attenuates progressive LV remodelling in dogs with moderate HF and may be useful in treating patients with chronic HF.
12554648	PDE5 is converted to an activated state upon cGMP binding to the GAF A domain.	cGMP-specific, cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase (PDE5) regulates such physiological processes as smooth muscle relaxation and neuronal survival. PDE5 contains two N-terminal domains (GAF A and GAF B), but the functional roles of these domains have not been determined. Here we show that recombinant PDE5 is activated directly upon cGMP binding to the GAF A domain, and this effect does not require PDE5 phosphorylation. PDE5 exhibited time- and concentration-dependent reversible activation in response to cGMP, with the highest activation (9- to 11-fold) observed at low substrate concentrations (0.1 micro M cGMP). A monoclonal antibody directed against GAF A blocked cGMP binding, prevented PDE5 activation and decreased basal activity, revealing that PDE5 in its non-activated state has low intrinsic catalytic activity. Activated PDE5 showed higher sensitivity towards sildenafil than non-activated PDE5. The stimulatory effect of cGMP binding on the catalytic activity of PDE5 suggests that this mechanism of enzyme activation may be common among other GAF domain-containing proteins. The data also suggest that development of agonists and antagonists of PDE5 activity based on binding to this site might be possible.
12562791	In vitro and in vivo functional activity of Chlamydia MurA, a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and fosfomycin resistance.	Organisms of Chlamydia spp. are obligate intracellular, gram-negative bacteria with a dimorphic developmental cycle that takes place entirely within a membrane-bound vacuole termed an inclusion. The chlamydial anomaly refers to the fact that cell wall-active antibiotics inhibit Chlamydia growth and peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis genes are present in the genome, yet there is no biochemical evidence for synthesis of PG. In this work, we undertook a genetics-based approach to reevaluate the chlamydial anomaly by characterizing MurA, a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase that catalyzes the first committed step of PG synthesis. The murA gene from Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 was cloned and placed under the control of the arabinose-inducible, glucose-repressible ara promoter and transformed into Escherichia coli. After transduction of a lethal DeltamurA mutation into the strain, viability of the E. coli strain became dependent upon expression of the C. trachomatis murA. DNA sequence analysis of murA from C. trachomatis predicted a cysteine-to-aspartate change in a key residue within the active site of MurA. In E. coli, the same mutation has previously been shown to cause resistance to fosfomycin, a potent antibiotic that specifically targets MurA. In vitro activity of the chlamydial MurA was resistant to high levels of fosfomycin. Growth of C. trachomatis was also resistant to fosfomycin. Moreover, fosfomycin resistance was imparted to the E. coli strain expressing the chlamydial murA. Conversion of C. trachomatis elementary bodies to reticulate bodies and cell division are correlated with expression of murA mRNA. mRNA from murB, the second enzymatic reaction in the PG pathway, was also detected during C. trachomatis infection. Our findings, as well as work from other groups, suggest that a functional PG pathway exists in Chlamydia spp. We propose that chlamydial PG is essential for progression through the developmental cycle as well as for cell division. Elucidating the existence of PG in Chlamydia spp. is of significance for the development of novel antibiotics targeting the chlamydial cell wall.
12562875	Differential modulation of Toll-like receptors by fatty acids: preferential inhibition by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	Human subjects consuming fish oil showed a significant suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in blood monocytes when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Results with a murine monocytic cell line (RAW 264.7) stably transfected with COX-2 promoter reporter gene also demonstrated that LPS-induced COX-2 expression was preferentially inhibited by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3), the major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) present in fish oil. Additionally, DHA and EPA significantly suppressed COX-2 expression induced by a synthetic lipopeptide, a TLR2 agonist. These results correlated with the preferential suppression of LPS- or lipopeptide-induced NF kappa B activation by DHA and EPA. The target of inhibition by DHA is TLR itself or its associated molecules, but not downstream signaling components. In contrast, COX-2 expression by TLR2 or TRL4 agonist was potentiated by lauric acid, a saturated fatty acid. These results demonstrate that inhibition of COX-2 expression by n-3 PUFAs is mediated through the modulation of TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, the beneficial or detrimental effects of different types of dietary fatty acids on the risk of the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases may be in part mediated through the modulation of TLRs.
12563315	PUMA-G and HM74 are receptors for nicotinic acid and mediate its anti-lipolytic effect.	Nicotinic acid (niacin), a vitamin of the B complex, has been used for almost 50 years as a lipid-lowering drug. The pharmacological effect of nicotinic acid requires doses that are much higher than those provided by a normal diet. Its primary action is to decrease lipolysis in adipose tissue by inhibiting hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase. This anti-lipolytic effect of nicotinic acid involves the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in adipose tissue through a G(i)-protein-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A G-protein-coupled receptor for nicotinic acid has been proposed in adipocytes. Here, we show that the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, 'protein upregulated in macrophages by interferon-gamma' (mouse PUMA-G, human HM74), is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a nicotinic acid receptor. Binding of nicotinic acid to PUMA-G or HM74 results in a G(i)-mediated decrease in cAMP levels. In mice lacking PUMA-G, the nicotinic acid-induced decrease in free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride plasma levels was abrogated, indicating that PUMA-G mediates the anti-lipolytic and lipid-lowering effects of nicotinic acid in vivo. The identification of the nicotinic acid receptor may be useful in the development of new drugs to treat dyslipidemia.
12564641	Effects of clozapine on the efflux of serotonin and dopamine in the rat brain: the role of 5-HT1A receptors.	In vivo microdialysis in conscious rats was used to examine the effect of clozapine on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) efflux in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus and dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex. Both systemic and local administration of clozapine (systemic, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.; local, 100 microM) increased 5-HT efflux in the dorsal raphe. However, in the prefrontal cortex, dialysate 5-HT increased when clozapine (100 microM) was administered through the probe, while no effect was observed when it was administered systemically. By pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist p-MPPI (3 mg/kg, i.p.), systemic treatment of clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased 5-HT efflux in the prefrontal cortex. This result suggests that the ability of clozapine to enhance the extracellular concentrations of 5-HT in the dorsal raphe attenuates this drug's effect in the frontal cortex, probably through the stimulation of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe. We also found that pretreatment with p-MPPI (3 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated by 45% the rise in cortical dopamine levels induced by clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings imply that the reduction in serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nucleus induced by clozapine could lead to an increase in dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex.
12564662	The biochemical selectivity of novel COX-2 inhibitors in whole blood assays of COX-isozyme activity.	We have evaluated the biochemical selectivity of novel cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, etoricoxib, valdecoxib, DFU and DFP, vs rofecoxib and celecoxib, using the human whole blood assays of COX-isozyme activity, in vitro. Compounds were incubated with human whole blood samples, allowed to clot for 1 h at 37 degrees C, or stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (10 microg/ml) for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Serum thromboxane (TX) B2 and plasma prostaglandin (PG) E2 levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassays as indices of platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity, respectively. Valdecoxib, etoricoxib, DFU and DFP inhibited platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 with the following COX-1/COX-2 IC50 ratios: 61.5, 344, 660 and 1918, respectively. The reference compounds, celecoxib and rofecoxib had corresponding values of 29.6 and 272. In conclusion, a second wave of COX-2 inhibitors with higher biochemical selectivity than the existing coxibs has been developed. Whether their administration will be associated with improved clinical efficacy and/or safety vis-à-vis celecoxib and rofecoxib remains to be established.
12573452	Inhibition by eicosapentaenoic acid of IL-1beta-induced PGHS-2 expression in human microvascular endothelial cells: involvement of lipoxygenase-derived metabolites and p38 MAPK pathway.	Prostaglandin H synthase 2 (PGHS-2), a highly inducible isoenzyme, is responsible for overproduction of the prostaglandins (PGs) in inflammatory sites. We established that among fish oil polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), greatly decreased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced PGHS-2 expression in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Lipoxygenase products 12 (S)-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid ((S)-HpEPE), 15 (S)-HpEPE and leukotriene (LT) D5 reproduced similar inhibitory effect, suggesting that they may be the intermediate metabolites responsible for PGHS-2 down-regulation by EPA. Accordingly, the EPA effect is prevented by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and by REV 5901, nonspecific and specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, respectively. Besides, inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity by ibuprofen, indomethacin or aspirin was not able to prevent this effect. Moreover, cyclooxygenase metabolites of EPA (PGs D3, E3 and I3) markedly potentiate IL-1beta-induced PGHS-2 expression, probably by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are known to be activated by fatty acids (FAs) such as EPA. We found here that HPMECs express only weak amounts of PPARalpha and PPARgamma whose activation by synthetic agonists, Wy-14,643 and ciglitazone, does not cause any inhibition of IL-1beta-induced PGHS-2 expression. This finding ruled out the involvement of PPARs in the EPA inhibitory effect. In addition, we established that EPA, which failed to inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, suppressed p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in stimulated HPMECs. Our data demonstrate that EPA, unlike DHA, down-regulates PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs probably through its 5-lipoxygenase-dependent metabolites and advocates a beneficial role for this FA in limiting inflammatory response.
12584187	Acid-sensing ion channels in malignant gliomas.	High grade glioma cells derived from patient biopsies express an amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance that has properties attributed to the human brain sodium channel family, also known as acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). This amiloride-sensitive conductance was not detected in cells obtained from normal brain tissue or low grade or benign tumors. Differential gene profiling data showed that ASIC1 and ASIC2 mRNA were present in normal and low grade tumor cells. Although ASIC1 was present in all of the high grade glial cells examined, ASIC2 mRNA was detected in less than half. The main purpose of our work was to examine the molecular mechanisms that may underlie the constitutively activated sodium currents present in high grade glioma cells. Our results show that 1) gain-of-function mutations of ASIC1 were not present in a number of freshly resected and cultured high grade gliomas, 2) syntaxin 1A inhibited ASIC currents only when ASIC1 and ASIC2 were co-expressed, and 3) the inhibition of ASIC currents by syntaxin 1A had an absolute requirement for either gamma- or delta-hENaC. Transfection of cultured cells originally derived from high grade gliomas (U87-MG and SK-MG1) with ASIC2 abolished basal amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance; this inhibition was reversed by dialysis of the cell interior with Munc-18, a syntaxin-binding protein that typically blocks the interaction of syntaxin with other proteins. Thus, syntaxin 1A cannot inhibit Na(+) permeability in the absence of adequate plasma membrane ASIC2 expression, accounting for the observed functional expression of amiloride-sensitive currents in high grade glioma cells.
12589396	Changes in human in vivo serotonin and dopamine transporter availabilities during chronic antidepressant administration.	Few studies have demonstrated in vivo alterations of human serotonin and dopamine transporters (SERTS and DATS) during antidepressant treatment. The current study measured these transporter availabilities with [(123)I]beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or a non-SSRI, bupropion. A total of 17 healthy human subjects were randomly assigned to two different treatment protocols: (1). citalopram (40 mg/day) followed by augmentation with bupropion (100 mg/day) or (2). bupropion (100-200 mg/day) for 16 days. Citalopram significantly inhibited [(123)I]beta-CIT binding to SERT in brainstem (51.4%) and diencephalon (39.4%) after 8 days of administration, which was similarly observed after 16 days. In contrast, citalopram significantly increased striatal DAT binding by 15-17% after 8 and 16 days of administration. Bupropion and its augmentation to citalopram did not have a significant effect on DAT or SERT. In 10 depressed patients who were treated with paroxetine (20 mg/day), a similar increase in DAT and inhibition of SERT were observed during 6 weeks treatment. The results demonstrated the inhibition of SERT by SSRI in human in vivo during the chronic treatment and, unexpectedly, an elevation of DAT. This apparent SSRI-induced modulation of the dopamine system may be associated with the side effects of these agents, including sexual dysfunction.
12589516	Occupancy of 5-HT1A receptors by clozapine in the primate brain: a PET study.	The pharmacological mechanism underlying the atypical properties of the antipsychotic drug clozapine remains to be identified. The serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor subtype has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and is one among several central neuroreceptors for which clozapine has moderate affinity in vitro.
12604678	Nateglinide, a D-phenylalanine derivative lacking either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety, specifically inhibits pancreatic beta-cell-type K(ATP) channels.	A novel antidiabetic agent, nateglinide, is a D-phenylalanine derivative lacking either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety. We examined with the patch-clamp method the effect of nateglinide on recombinant ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected with a Kir6.2 subunit and either of a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1, SUR2A, and SUR2B. In inside-out patches, nateglinide reversibly inhibited the spontaneous openings of all three types of SUR/Kir6.2 channels. Nateglinide inhibited SUR1/Kir6.2 channels with high and low affinities (K(i) = 75 nM and 114 microM) but SUR2A/Kir6.2 and SUR2B/Kir6.2 channels only with low affinity (K(i) = 105 and 111 microM, respectively). Nateglinide inhibited the K(ATP) current mediated by Kir6.2 lacking C-terminal 26 amino acids only with low affinity (K(i) = 290 microM) in the absence of SUR. Replacement of serine at position 1237 of SUR1 to tyrosine [SUR1(S1237Y)] specifically abolished the high-affinity inhibition of SUR1/Kir6.2 channels by nateglinide. MgADP or MgUDP (100 microM) augmented the inhibitory effect of nateglinide on SUR1/Kir6.2 but not SUR1(S1237Y)/Kir6.2 or SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels. This augmenting effect of MgADP was also observed with the SUR1/Kir6.2(K185Q) channel, which was not inhibited by MgADP, but not with the SUR1(K1384A)/Kir6.2 channel, which was not activated by MgADP. These results indicate that therapeutic concentrations of nateglinide (approximately 10 microM) may selectively inhibit pancreatic type SUR1/Kir6.2 channels through SUR1, especially when the channel is activated by intracellular MgADP, even though the agent does not contain either a sulfonylurea or benzamido moiety.
12606318	Characterization of a lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase from Pneumocystis carinii.	Pneumocystis carinii (PC) causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. PC is intrinsically resistant to treatment with azole antifungal medications. The enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (Erg11) is the target for azole antifungals. We cloned PCERG11 and compared its sequence to Erg11 proteins present in azole-resistant organisms, and performed chromosomal and Northern blot analysis for PCERG11. Of 13 potential sites which could confer resistance to azoles, two were identical to azole-resistant Candida. By site-directed mutagenesis we changed these two sites in PCERG11 to those present in azole-sensitive Candida to generate PCERG11-SDM (E113D, T125K). We tested the susceptibility of ERG11 deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) expressing PCERG11, PCERG11-SDM, and wild-type SCERG11 to three azole antifungals: fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. PCERG11 required a 2.2-fold higher dose of voriconazole and 3.5-fold higher dose of fluconazole than SCERG11 for a 50% reduction in growth. No difference was observed in the sensitivity to itraconazole. PCERG11-SDM has increased sensitivity to fluconazole and voriconazole, but not itraconazole. We believe that the molecular structure of the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase encoded by PCERG11 confers inherent resistance to azole antifungals and plays an integral part in the overall resistance of this PC to azole therapy.
12613273	[Influence of ACE inhibitor spirapril on left ventricular hypertrophy].	In view of the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with essential hypertension, (15-30%), with an increased risk (2-4 x) of developing myocardial infarction, heart failure or malignant arrhythmia, possibly even leading to sudden cardiac death, effective reversal of LVH is a major aim of treatment. For this purpose, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proved to be most suitable.
12618228	Effects of propafenone and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxypropafenone, on HERG channels.	Propafenone is a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. During chronic therapy, it undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism to 5-hydroxypropafenone. In the present study we have analysed the effects of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone on HERG current.

12644588	Characterization of celecoxib and valdecoxib binding to cyclooxygenase.	Two compounds (celecoxib and valdecoxib) from the diarylheterocycle class of cyclooxygenase inhibitors were radiolabeled and used to characterize their binding to cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), several single-point variants of COX-2 (Val523Ile, Tyr355Ala, Arg120Ala, Arg120Gln, Arg120Asn) and one triple-point variant of COX-2 [Val523Ile, Arg513His, Val434Ile (IHI)]. We demonstrate highly specific and saturable binding of these inhibitors to COX-2. Under the same assay conditions, little or no specific binding to COX-1 could be detected. The affinity of [(3)H]celecoxib for COX-2 (K(D) = 2.3 nM) was similar to the affinity of [(3)H]valdecoxib (K(D) = 3.2 nM). The binding to COX-2 seems to be both rapid and slowly reversible with association rates of 5.8 x 10(6)/M/min and 4.5 x 10(6)/M/min and dissociation rates of 14 x 10(-3)/min (t(1/2) = 50 min) and 7.0 x 10(-3)/min (t(1/2) = 98 min) for [(3)H]celecoxib and [(3)H]valdecoxib, respectively. These association rates increased (4- to 11-fold) when the charged arginine residue located at the entrance to the main hydrophobic channel was mutated to smaller uncharged amino acids (Arg120Ala, Arg120Gln, and Arg120Asn). Mutation of residues located within the active site of COX-2 that define a 'side pocket' (Tyr355Ala, Val523Ile, IHI) of the main channel had a greater effect on the dissociation rate than the association rate. These mutations, which modified the shape of and access to the 'side pocket', affected the binding affinity of [(3)H]valdecoxib more than that of [(3)H]celecoxib. These binding studies provide direct insight into the properties and binding constants of celecoxib and valdecoxib to COX-2.
12646212	Molecular identification of nicotinic acid receptor.	Nicotinic acid and its derivative, Acipimox, have been widely used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that they exert the beneficial effect through the activation of a Gi-protein-coupled receptor on adipocyte, which has remained elusive to date. Here we show that a novel GPCR, designated HM74b because of its high similarity to HM74, is a receptor for nicotinic acid. HM74b mRNA is found in human, murine, and rat adipose tissues. Nicotinic acid and Acipimox inhibit forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation in human HM74b-expressing cells and activate GTP gamma S binding in a dose-dependent manner. [3H]Nicotinic acid specifically binds to HM74b-expressing membrane and its binding is replaced by Acipimox. This finding will open a new phase of research on the physiological role of nicotinic acid and will be a clue to develop novel antihyperlipidemic drugs.
12649191	Trimetrexate inhibits progression of the murine 32Dp210 model of chronic myeloid leukemia in animals expressing drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase.	Expression of drug-resistant forms of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in hematopoietic cells confers substantial resistance of animals to antifolate administration. In this study, we tested whether the chemoprotection conferred by expression of the tyrosine-22 variant DHFR could be used for more effective therapy of the 32Dp210 murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Administration of the maximum tolerated dose of trimetrexate (TMTX) with the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose-5'-monophosphate (NBMPR-P) inhibited 32Dp210 tumor progression in mice engrafted with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow and improved survival of tumor-bearing animals as long as drug administration was continued. NBMPR-P coadministration was necessary for maximal tumor inhibition, as administration of TMTX alone delayed but did not prevent tumor progression. The chemoprotection afforded by engraftment with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow was necessary for effective chemotherapy, as normal mice lacking transgenic marrow could not tolerate the higher TMTX dose (60 mg/kg/day) administered to mice with transgenic marrow, and the decreased dose of TMTX with NBMPR-P tolerated by normal tumor-bearing animals did not inhibit tumor progression or improve animal survival. We conclude that TMTX with NBMPR-P inhibits tumor progression in the 32Dp210 model of CML in animals engrafted with drug-resistant tyrosine-22 DHFR transgenic marrow, and that based on this model the introduction of a drug-resistant DHFR gene into marrow combined with TMTX and NBMPR-P administration may provide an effective treatment for CML.
12650887	Effect of pacing and mexiletine on dispersion of repolarisation and arrhythmias in DeltaKPQ SCN5A (long QT3) mice.	It has been suggested that both pacing and treatment with mexiletine may reduce torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias in patients with long QT syndrome 3 (LQT3), but it is not fully understood how these interventions could prevent TdP. We therefore studied the effects of pacing and mexiletine in mice with a heterozygous knock-in DeltaKPQ SCN5A(Delta/+) deletion (SCN5A-Tg), a murine LQT3 model.
12654248	ANKTM1, a TRP-like channel expressed in nociceptive neurons, is activated by cold temperatures.	Mammals detect temperature with specialized neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Four TRPV-class channels have been implicated in sensing heat, and one TRPM-class channel in sensing cold. The combined range of temperatures that activate these channels covers a majority of the relevant physiological spectrum sensed by most mammals, with a significant gap in the noxious cold range. Here, we describe the characterization of ANKTM1, a cold-activated channel with a lower activation temperature compared to the cold and menthol receptor, TRPM8. ANKTM1 is a distant family member of TRP channels with very little amino acid similarity to TRPM8. It is found in a subset of nociceptive sensory neurons where it is coexpressed with TRPV1/VR1 (the capsaicin/heat receptor) but not TRPM8. Consistent with the expression of ANKTM1, we identify noxious cold-sensitive sensory neurons that also respond to capsaicin but not to menthol.
12658774	Study on the mechanism of the annexin II-mediated co-assembly of t-PA and plasminogen.	In order to further investigate the effect of annexin II (Ann-II) on tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-dependent plasminogen (PLG) activation and its interactive mechanism, recombinant native Ann-II bound t-PA, PLG and plasmin with high affinity was examined. The flow cytometric assay showed that the ann-II expression rate was higher in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) (87.65%) than in the HL-60 cells as controls (35.79%). Two irrelevant proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and equine IgG (EIG) had no effect on the production of plasmin. Ann-II-mediated enhancement of t-PA-dependent PLG activation was inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid or by pretreatment of Ann-II with carboxypeptidase B with the inhibitive rate being 77.8% and 77.0%, respectively. It was revealed that the effect of Ann-II on PLG activation was specific for t-PA. Urokinase didn't bind to Ann-II, demonstrating the role of receptor-related lysine residues on activation of PLG, showing that the Ann-II-PLG interaction was dependent upon carboxyl-terminal lysine residues. These findings suggest that annexin II-mediated co-assembly of t-PA and PLG may promote plasmin generation and play a key role in modulating fibrinolysis on the endothelial surface.

12710529	Angiotensin-II-induced enhanced expression of Gi proteins is attenuated by losartan in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells: role of AT1 receptors.	We have previously shown that treatment of A10 vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) with angiotensin II (Ang II) enhanced the expression of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (Gi alpha2 and Gi alpha3). In the present studies, we have investigated the role of type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT1) in the Ang-II-induced enhanced expression of Gi alpha proteins and their functions in A10 SMCs. Ang II enhanced the levels of Gi alpha2 and Gi alpha3 proteins and their mRNA, as determined by Western and Northern blot analysis, respectively; losartan treatment attenuated the enhanced expression of Gi alpha2 and Gi alpha3 proteins and their mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase induced by Ang II and des(Glu18,Ser19,Glu20,Leu21,Gly22)ANP(4-23)-NH2 (C-ANP(4-23)), which was attenuated by Ang-II treatment, was partially restored by losartan treatment. Similarly, losartan was also able to restore the Ang-II-induced stimulatory responses of isoproterenol and N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA) on adenylyl cyclase activity. These results suggest a role for AT1 receptors in Ang-II-evoked increases in Gi alpha protein expression and Gs-mediated stimulation in VSMCs.
12726885	Stress interacts with peripheral cholinesterase inhibitors to cause central nervous system effects.	Pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a peripheral cholinesterase inhibitor, has been shown to have central cholinesterase inhibition properties under certain conditions (such as when ingested with other chemical compounds or following a high level of stress). Here we tested if stressing rats, using an intermittent 1 hr tailshock protocol, affected the degree of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition caused by a subsequent single injection of PB (2.0 mg/kg) or neostigmine bromide (NB, 0.32 mg/kg), another peripheral carbamate cholinesterase inhibitor. Stressed rats treated with PB had lower levels of AChE activity in the basal forebrain/striatum, but not in other brain areas. Stressed rats treated with NB did not show basal forebrain/striatum AChE activity changes but did show minor reductions of AChE activity in the cortex and cerebellum. These results confirm that prior stress can change the characteristic actions of certain peripherally acting drugs, thus possibly leading to unexpected central nervous system effects. Possible causes for these effects are discussed.
12736332	Amiloride-insensitive currents of the acid-sensing ion channel-2a (ASIC2a)/ASIC2b heteromeric sour-taste receptor channel.	Acid-sensing ion channel-2a (ASIC2a) is an amiloride-blockable proton-gated cation channel, probably contributing to sour-taste detection in rat taste cells. To isolate another subtype of the sour-taste receptor, we screened a rat circumvallate papilla cDNA library and identified ASIC2b, an N-terminal splice variant of ASIC2a. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses confirmed the expression of ASIC2b transcripts in the circumvallate papilla and, moreover, demonstrated its expression in the foliate and fungiform papillae. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that ASIC2b, as well as ASIC2a, was expressed in a subpopulation of taste cells in the circumvallate, foliate, and fungiform papillae, and some of the cells displayed both ASIC2a and ASIC2b immunoreactivities. Subsequent coimmunoprecipitation studies with circumvallate papillae extracts indicated that ASIC2b associated with ASIC2a to form assemblies and, together with our immunohistochemical findings, strongly suggested that both ASIC2 subunits formed heteromeric channels in taste cells in the circumvallate, foliate, and fungiform papillae. Oocyte electrophysiology demonstrated that the ASIC2a/ASIC2b channel generated maximal inward currents at a pH of < or =2.0, which is in agreement with the in vivo pH sensitivity of rat taste cells, and that the amiloride sensitivity of the heteromer decreased with decreasing pH and was almost completely abolished at a pH of 2.0. These findings provide persuasive explanations for the amiloride insensitivity of acid-induced responses of rat taste cells.
12761331	3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "Ecstasy") induces fenfluramine-like proliferative actions on human cardiac valvular interstitial cells in vitro.	Recent findings have implicated the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B (5-HT2B) serotonin receptor in mediating the heart valve fibroplasia [valvular heart disease (VHD)] and primary pulmonary hypertension observed in patients taking the now-banned appetite suppressant fenfluramine (Pondimin, Redux). Via large-scale, random screening of a portion of the receptorome, we have discovered that the amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "Ecstasy") and its N-demethylated metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) each preferentially bind to and activate human recombinant 5-HT2B receptors. We also demonstrate that MDMA and MDA, like fenfluramine and its N-deethylated metabolite norfenfluramine, elicit prolonged mitogenic responses in human valvular interstitial cells via activation of 5-HT2B receptors. We also report that pergolide and dihydroergotamine, two drugs recently demonstrated to induce VHD in humans, potently activate 5-HT2B receptors, thus validating this assay system for its ability to predict medications that might induce VHD. Our discovery that MDMA and a major metabolite, MDA, induce prolonged mitogenic responses in vitro similar to those induced by fenfluramine and norfenfluramine in vivo (i.e., valvular interstitial cell fibroplasia) predict that long-term MDMA use could lead to the development of fenfluramine-like VHD. Because of the widespread abuse of MDMA, these findings have major public health implications. These findings also underscore the necessity of screening current and future drugs at h5-HT2B receptors for agonist actions before their use in humans.
12763661	The interaction of metal ions and Marimastat with matrix metalloproteinase 9.	The effect of a range of metal ions on the ability of Marimastat to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was examined in a fluorescence based proteolytic assay. Whilst none of the metals examined significantly affected the inhibitory ability of Marimastat, several metal ions did have a significant effect on MMP-9 activity itself. In the absence of Marimastat, Zn(II) and Fe(II) significantly inhibited MMP-9 activity at metal ion concentrations of 10 and 100 microM, respectively. In both the absence and presence of Marimastat, Cd(II) significantly inhibited MMP-9 at 100 microM. In contrast, 1 mM Co(II) significantly upregulated MMP-9 proteolytic activity.
12764427	Nateglinide: A structurally novel, short-acting, hypoglycemic agent.	Nateglinide is a short-acting, pancreatic, beta-cell-selective, K(ATP) potassium channel blocker that improves overall glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Although nateglinide's mechanism of action is related to that of sulphonyl-ureas and repaglinide, important differences do exist. Nateglinide binds rapidly to the sulfonylurea SUR1 receptor with a relatively low affinity, and it dissociates from it extremely rapidly in a manner of seconds. This rapid association and dissociation gives nateglinide a unique "fast on-fast off" effect. Thus, nateglinide has a rapid onset and short duration of action stimulating insulin secretion in vivo and providing good control of postprandial hyperglycemia when taken immediately prior to meals. The rapid action of nateglinide on the beta cells stimulates and restores the normal physiological first and early phase of insulin secretion, consequently reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. This hypoglycemic effect of nateglinide leads to improved glycemic control, while the short duration avoids delayed hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia after meals. Nateglinide is not a sulfonylurea, but it shares the mechanism of action of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents such as glibenclamide and glipizide. Like the recently introduced, short-acting agent, repaglinide, it does not incorporate a sulfonylurea moiety. However, nateglinide's effects on insulin secretion and glycemic control differ significantly from the sulfonylureas and repaglinide in that it preferentially stimulates acute phase insulin, better controls postprandial glucose excursions and spikes, and causes less hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Compounds with such a profile should not only achieve improved overall glucose control, but also reduce the risk of vascular complications which is the most important feature of nateglinide. Clinical studies with nateglinide have confirmed that it acts rapidly and both restores insulin release and attenuates the postprandial glucose spike. Nateglinide is both effective and well tolerated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The reported overall profile of adverse effects appears to be superior to that of other K(ATP) potassium channel blockers, the glucose modulator metformin and PPARgamma agonists such as troglitazone. Clinical comparisons of these agents have shown nateglinide to be more effective in attenuating postprandial glucose than any other oral hypoglycemic agent, and that treatment with both nateglinide and metformin provides additive effects that afford improved control of plasma glucose levels. The administration regimen for nateglinide, immediately prior to meals, also facilitates patient compliance. (c) 2001 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
12776178	Effects of ligand and thyroid hormone receptor isoforms on hepatic gene expression profiles of thyroid hormone receptor knockout mice.	Little is known about the overall patterns of thyroid hormone (Th)-mediated gene regulation by the main Th receptor (Tr) isoforms, Tr-alpha and Tr-beta, in vivo. We used 48 complementary DNA microarrays to examine hepatic gene expression profiles of wild-type and Thra and Thrb knockout mice under different Th conditions: no treatment, treatment with 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T(3)), Th-deprivation using propylthiouracil (PTU), and treatment with a combination of PTU and T(3). Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that positively regulated genes fit into three main expression patterns. In addition, only a subpopulation of target genes repressed basal transcription in the absence of ligand. Interestingly, Thra and Thrb knockout mice showed similar gene expression patterns to wild-type mice, suggesting that these isoforms co-regulate most hepatic target genes. Differences in the gene expression patterns of Thra/Thrb double-knockout mice and Th-deprived wild-type mice show that absence of receptor and of hormone can have different effects. This large-scale study of hormonal regulation reveals the functions of Th and of Tr isoforms in the regulation of gene expression patterns.
1278093	The mechanism of action of the thioureylene antithyroid drugs.	A model incubation system containing purified thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was used to study the mechanism of action of the thioureylene anti-thyroid drugs--propylthiouracil (PTU), methylmercapto imidazole (MMI) and carbimazole. Two general types of experiments were performed: a) measurement of the inhibitory effects of the drugs on TPO-catalyzed iodination and on TPO-catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol, and b) studies of the metabolism of PTU and MMI by the TPO model system. The major observations can be summarized as follows: 1) The thioureylene drugs are potent inhibitors of TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein and tyrosine. Their potency increases greatly as the concentration of I- decreases. 2) The thioureylene drugs are also potent inhibitors of TPO-catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol, a reaction that does not involve iodide. 3) MMI and PTU are readily oxidized in the model incubation system when iodide is present but not in the absence of iodide. The rate of oxidation increased as the iodide concentration was increased from 10 to 100 muM. 4) Oxidation of PTU and MMI by the model incubation system is inhibited by relatively slight increases in the concentration of PTU and MMI. These drugs are capable of inhibiting their own and each other's metabolism. 5) Inhibition of iodination is competitively antagonized by iodide at low drug concentrations, but not at higher drug concentrations. 6) Inhibition of iodination by MMI and PTU may be either reversible (low ratio of drug to iodide), or irreversible (higher ratio of drug to iodide). In reversible inhibition the iodination is inhibited for a period which may be as brief as 2 min or as long as 20 min, but thereafter, iodination begins, and there is escape from inhibition. During the lag-period there is extensive metabolism of the drug. In the case of irreversible inhibition of iodination is inhibited completely or almost completely for 60 min, and drug oxidation during this period is relatively low. 7) Irreversible inhibition may be transformed into reversible inhibition by increasing the concentration of TPO or the concentration of iodide. However, increasing the concentration of H2O2 or of tyrosine does not overcome irreversible inhibition. On the basis of these findings and of current views concerning the mechanism of enzymatic iodination, a scheme is proposed for the mechanism of inhibition by thioureylene drugs of TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein and tyrosine.
12782193	Pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory potencies of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists eprosartan and candesartan.	The aim of the present study was to determine the inhibitory potency of two selective angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists, eprosartan and candesartan, at the level of the sympathetic nerve terminal and the vascular smooth muscle. Male New Zealand White rabbits, weighing 2100-2550 g, were used. To study eprosartan and candesartan at the neuronal angiotensin AT(1) receptor, we investigated their influence on the angiotensin II-enhanced, electrical field stimulation-evoked sympathetic transmission in the rabbit isolated thoracic aorta in a noradrenaline spillover model. To study both antagonists at the vascular angiotensin AT(1) receptor, concentration-response curves for angiotensin II were constructed in the presence or absence of the two angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II (10 nM) caused a significant increase by 107+/-11.1% of the stimulation-evoked sympathetic outflow, which was concentration-dependently inhibited by both eprosartan (pIC(50) 7.91+/-0.12) and candesartan (pIC(50) 10.76+/-0.13). Angiotensin II (1 nM-0.3 microM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in contractile force (E(max) 20.62+/-2.24 mN, pD(2) 8.16+/-0.04). Both eprosartan (pA(2) 8.90+/-0.11, pIC(50) 8.87+/-0.12 (10 nM angiotensin II)) and candesartan (pD(2)' 10.80+/-0.13) counteracted the contractions evoked by cumulative concentrations of angiotensin II. Candesartan proved a more potent antagonist than eprosartan at both the pre- and postjunctional angiotensin AT(1) receptor. For eprosartan, vascular inhibitory concentrations were 10-fold lower than sympatho-inhibitory concentrations, whereas for candesartan, inhibitory concentrations at both sites were similar. The results may be explained by differences between the pre- and postjunctional angiotensin AT(1) receptor subtype.
12784866	Eicosapentaenoic acid-induced apoptosis depends on acyl CoA-synthetase.	Marine n-3 FA are known to inhibit proliferation or induce cell death in several cancer cell lines. We have previously reported that EPA promotes apoptosis in the lymphoma cell line Ramos, whereas the U-698 cell line is insensitive to EPA. Furthermore, acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) is expressed to a higher extent in Ramos cells compared to U-698 cells. To investigate the importance of ACS in EPA-induced apoptosis, we incubated Ramos cells with triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACS. This caused a 70% reduction in the amount of cell-associated EPA and diminished activation of EPA. In addition, triacsin C caused a 90% reduction in EPA-induced apoptosis. Several different approaches were tried to overexpress ACS4 in EPA-insensitive lymphoma cell lines, but we did not obtain viable cells with high expression of acyl-CoA activation. However, we show that overexpression of ACS4 in the more robust COS-1 cells caused up to a fivefold increase in activation of EPA and a 67% increase in the amount of cell-associated radiolabeled EPA. Furthermore, we observed 28% elevated cellular level of TAG in EPA-incubated COS-1 cells overexpressing ACS4. The present study provides new information about ACS as an important enzyme for EPA-induced apoptosis in Ramos cells. Our data offer a potential mechanism that may explain the effect of dietary marine n-3 PUFA on growth of certain malignant cells.
12795770	Clinical response to alefacept: results of a phase 3 study of intramuscular administration of alefacept in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.	Recognition of psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated immune disease has led to the development of various therapeutic approaches directed against the pathogenic T cells. Alefacept, a novel and selective biological recombinant protein, binds CD2 on T cells to block T-cell activation and proliferation and interacts with FcgammaRIII receptors on accessory cells to produce selective T-cell apoptosis.
12818951	The inhibitory effects of ketamine and pentobarbital on substance p receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.	Substance P receptors (SPR) modulate nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord. The effects of IV anesthetics on SPR are not clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of IV anesthetics on SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We examined the effects of ketamine, pentobarbital, propofol, and tramadol on SP-induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents mediated by SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a whole-cell voltage clamp. Ketamine and pentobarbital inhibited the SPR-induced currents at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, but propofol and tramadol had little effect on the currents. We also studied the effects of ketamine and pentobarbital on [(3)H]-SP to SPR. Ketamine and pentobarbital inhibited the specific binding of [(3)H]-SP to SPR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Scatchard analysis of [(3)H]-SP binding revealed that ketamine and pentobarbital decreased the apparent dissociation constant for binding and maximal binding, indicating noncompetitive inhibition. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I did not abolish the inhibitory effects of ketamine and pentobarbital on SP-induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents. The results suggest that ketamine and pentobarbital inhibit SPR function. The mechanism of their inhibition on SPR function could not be through activation of the PKC pathway and may be due to noncompetitive displacing the SP binding.
12830709	[Differential protein analysis in rat renal proximal tubule epithelial cells in response to acetazolamide and its relation with the inhibition of AQP1].	To study the endogenous mechanism for the inhibition of aquaporin-1 expression in rat renal proximal tubule epithelial cells in response to acetazolamide.
12839875	The general anesthetic propofol increases brain N-arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide) content and inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase.	1. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is widely used as a general anesthetic and for the maintenance of long-term sedation. We have tested the hypothesis that propofol alters endocannabinoid brain content and that this effect contributes to its sedative properties. 2. A sedating dose of propofol in mice produced a significant increase in the whole-brain content of the endocannabinoid, N-arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide), when administered intraperitoneally in either Intralipid or emulphor-ethanol vehicles. 3. In vitro, propofol is a competitive inhibitor (IC(50) 52 micro M; 95% confidence interval 31, 87) of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which catalyzes the degradation of anandamide. Within a series of propofol analogs, the critical structural determinants of FAAH inhibition and sedation were found to overlap. Other intravenous general anesthetics, including midazolam, ketamine, etomidate, and thiopental, do not affect FAAH activity at sedative-relevant concentrations. Thiopental, however, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of FAAH at a concentration of 2 mM. 4. Pretreatment of mice with the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716 (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.) significantly reduced the number of mice that lost their righting reflex in response to propofol. Pretreatment of mice with the CB(1) receptor agonist, Win 55212-2 (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.), significantly potentiated the loss of righting reflex produced by propofol. These data indicate that CB(1) receptor activity contributes to the sedative properties of propofol. 5. These data suggest that propofol activation of the endocannabinoid system, possibly via inhibition of anandamide catabolism, contributes to the sedative properties of propofol and that FAAH could be a novel target for anesthetic development.
12872009	Bicarbonate-dependent chloride secretion in Calu-3 epithelia in response to 7,8-benzoquinoline.	Stimulation of Calu-3 epithelia with 7,8-benzoquinoline, under short circuit current conditions, produced a current increase that was completely accounted for by the net flux of chloride, measured simultaneously with 36Cl-. Nevertheless the current stimulated by 7,8-benzoquinoline was sensitive to acetazolamide, which caused up to 50 % inhibition of the stimulated current, the remainder being sensitive to the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransport inhibitor bumetanide. The effects of acetazolamide could be mimicked by either amiloride or by the di-sodium salt of 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DNDS) added to the basolateral side of the epithelium, but their actions were not additive. Amiloride was needed in sufficient concentration to inhibit the sodium-proton exchanger NHE1. DNDS blocks both the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE2 and the sodium-bicarbonate transporter NBC1. However, since 7,8-benzoquinoline activates basolateral K+ channels, causing hyperpolarisation, it is unlikely NBC1 is active after addition of 7,8-benzoquinoline. The effect of DNDS is, therefore, mainly on AE2. It is concluded that chloride enters the basolateral aspect of the cells using the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter and a parallel arrangement of NHE1 with AE2, these latter two being sensitive to acetazolamide because of their association with the cytoplasmic form of carbonic anhydrase CAII. The effects of acetazolamide could be mimicked by removal of HCO3-/CO2 from the bathing medium, and furthermore showed that the NHE1-AE2 mechanism is particularly important when the transport rate is high. Thus part of the current stimulated by 7,8-benzoquinoline and inhibited by acetazolamide or HCO3-/CO2 removal can be said to represent bicarbonate-dependent chloride secretion.
12873632	Nefazodone in the rat: mimicry and antagonism of [-]-DOM-induced stimulus control.	Nefazodone is presently marketed as an antidepressant that inhibits both serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and norepinephrine reuptake while antagonizing pirenpirone (5-HT2) receptors. This 5-HT receptor type is believed to play a prominent role in the underlying mechanism of action of serotonergic hallucinogens. Antidepressant medications now represent the most commonly prescribed psychoactive medications in the world and are likely to be ingested in the presence of hallucinogens with increased frequency; the consequences are largely unknown. The present investigation examined the interaction between the serotonergic phenethylamine hallucinogen [-]-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine ([-]-DOM), and nefazodone, in rats trained with [-]-DOM [0.6 mg/kg; 75 min pretreatment time] as a discriminative stimulus. The data indicate that maximal substitution of nefazodone for the [-]-DOM stimulus was present using a 45-min pretreatment time before testing. Using this pretreatment time, a dose of nefazodone of 12.0 mg/kg administered alone resulted in 76% DOM-appropriate responding. When a range of doses of nefazodone was combined with the training dose of [-]-DOM, a pattern of responding compatible with partial agonism was observed. The intermediate degree of [-]-DOM generalization to nefazodone was significantly antagonized by the 5-HT antagonists, 5-HT2, SR 46349B (5HT2A/2C), and M100907 (5-HT2A). Taken together, the present data suggest that (a) nefazodone acts as a partial agonist and (b) these effects are mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor.
12876237	Entacapone is beneficial in both fluctuating and non-fluctuating patients with Parkinson's disease: a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, six month study.	To study the effect of entacapone, a specific peripherally acting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor used in combination with levodopa treatment, in cases of Parkinson's disease with both fluctuating and non-fluctuating response to treatment.
12885787	Inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter by the venom peptide chi-MrIA. Site of action, Na+ dependence, and structure-activity relationship.	chi-Conopeptide MrIA (chi-MrIA) is a 13-residue peptide contained in the venom of the predatory marine snail Conus marmoreus that has been found to inhibit the norepinephrine transporter (NET). We investigated whether chi-MrIA targeted the other members of the monoamine transporter family and found no effect of the peptide (100 microM) on the activity of the dopamine transporter and the serotonin transporter, indicating a high specificity of action. The binding of the NET inhibitors, [3H]nisoxetine and [3H]mazindol, to the expressed rat and human NET was inhibited by chi-MrIA with the conopeptide displaying a slight preference toward the rat isoform. For both radioligands, saturation binding studies showed that the inhibition by chi-MrIA was competitive in nature. It has previously been demonstrated that chi-MrIA does not compete with norepinephrine, unlike classically described NET inhibitors such as nisoxetine and mazindol that do. This pattern of behavior implies that the binding site for chi-MrIA on the NET overlaps the antidepressant binding site and is wholly distinct from the substrate binding site. The inhibitory effect of chi-MrIA was found to be dependent on Na+ with the conopeptide becoming a less effective blocker of [3H]norepinephrine by the NET under the conditions of reduced extracellular Na+. In this respect, chi-MrIA is similar to the antidepressant inhibitors of the NET. The structure-activity relationship of chi-MrIA was investigated by alanine scanning. Four residues in the first cysteine-bracketed loop of chi-MrIA and a His in loop 2 played a dominant role in the interaction between chi-MrIA and the NET. H alpha chemical shift comparisons indicated that side-chain interactions at these key positions were structurally perturbed by the replacement of Gly-6. From these data, we present a model of the structure of chi-MrIA that shows the relative orientation of the key binding residues. This model provides a new molecular caliper for probing the structure of the NET.
12887610	Differential effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on platelet activating factor (PAF)- and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced equine platelet aggregation.	Compounds that activate adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inhibit equine platelet aggregation. Cyclic AMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase (PDE) and, in the present study, the effects of theophylline, a nonselective PDE inhibitor, and selective inhibitors of PDE isoenzymes PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5, on equine platelet aggregation in response to platelet activating factor (PAF) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) have been examined. Theophylline and the PDE3 inhibitors, trequinsin and quazinone, inhibited both PAF and ADP-induced aggregation in a concentration dependent manner. The inhibition of PAF-induced aggregation was, however, significantly greater than that of the response to ADP. The inhibitory effects of theophylline and the PDE3 inhibitors on ADP- but not PAF-, induced aggregation were reversed by addition of the calcium ionophore, A23187. Rolipram and zaprinast, inhibitors of PDE4 and PDE5, respectively, had no effect on either PAF- or ADP-induced aggregation. These results demonstrate that inhibition of aggregation caused by PAF or ADP can be achieved by selective inhibition of PDE3 but suggest that there may be agonist-specific differences in the intracellular signalling pathways that regulate equine platelet aggregation.
12890675	Akt activity negatively regulates phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in the heart.	In the heart, insulin stimulates a variety of kinase cascades and controls glucose utilization. Because insulin is able to activate Akt and inactivate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the heart, we hypothesized that Akt can regulate the activity of AMPK. To address the potential existence of this novel signaling pathway, we used a number of experimental protocols to activate Akt in cardiac myocytes and monitored the activation status of AMPK. Mouse hearts perfused in the presence of insulin demonstrated accelerated glycolysis and glucose oxidation rates as compared with non-insulin-perfused hearts. In addition, insulin caused an increase in Akt phosphorylation and a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation at its major regulatory site (threonine 172 of the alpha catalytic subunit). Transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active mutant form of Akt1 displayed decreased phosphorylation of cardiac alpha-AMPK. Isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes infected with an adenovirus expressing constitutively active mutant forms of either Akt1 or Akt2 also suppressed AMPK phosphorylation. However, Akt-dependent depression of alpha-AMPK phosphorylation could be overcome in the presence of the AMPK activator, metformin, suggesting that an override mechanism exists that can restore AMPK activity. Taken together, this study suggests that there is cross-talk between the AMPK and Akt pathways and that Akt activation can lead to decreased AMPK activity. In addition, our data suggest that the ability of insulin to inhibit AMPK may be controlled via an Akt-mediated mechanism.
12897821	Ethyl isopropyl amiloride inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration by inducing apoptosis and antagonizing urokinase plasminogen activator activity.	Amiloride inhibits activation of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger (NHE), a critical step in smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth. While amiloride treatment reduces SMC proliferation and migration, as well as experimental lesion formation, these effects are not exclusively due to NHE inhibition and remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanisms involved in amiloride-induced attenuation of SMC proliferation and migration, looking specifically at the potential role of apoptosis and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity in these processes. Rabbit SMCs in tissue culture were exposed to 10-80 microM of the amiloride analogue ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA). Compared with controls, EIPA reduced DNA synthesis, cell number, and mitochondrial respiration, but without toxic effects on quiescent or proliferating cells. In a Boyden chamber assay, EIPA reduced uPA-induced SMC migration. Moreover, in a SMC scratch assay EIPA treatment resulted in a 66% reduction in the number of repopulating cells, a 92% decrease in the number of proliferating cells, and a 37-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells. SMC apoptosis was frequently localized to the scratch edges, where cell proliferation and bcl-2 expression were absent. Finally, uPA enzymatic activity in the cell culture media was lower for EIPA-treated versus control SMCs. Therefore, EIPA inhibits both SMC proliferation and migration by inducing apoptosis and antagonizing uPA activity, respectively, and requires further study as an agent for reducing vascular lesion formation.
12920235	Identification of a novel glucocorticoid receptor mutation in budesonide-resistant human bronchial epithelial cells.	We developed a molecular genetic model to investigate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to the therapeutic steroid budesonide. Based on a genetic selection scheme using the human Chago K1 cell line and integrated copies of a glucocorticoid-responsive herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and a green fluorescent protein gene, we isolated five Chago K1 variants that grew in media containing budesonide and ganciclovir. Three spontaneous budesonide-resistant subclones were found to express low levels of GR, whereas two mutants isolated from ethylmethane sulfonate-treated cultures contained normal levels of GR protein. Analysis of the GR coding sequence in the budesonide-resistant subclone Ch-BdE5 identified a novel Val to Met mutation at amino acid position 575 (GRV575M) which caused an 80% decrease in transcriptional regulatory functions with only a minimal effect on ligand binding activity. Homology modeling of the GR structure in this region of the hormone binding domain and molecular dynamic simulations suggested that the GRV575M mutation would have a decreased affinity for the LXXLL motif of p160 coactivators. To test this prediction, we performed transactivation and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays using the p160 coactivator glucocorticoid interacting protein 1 (GRIP1)/transcriptional intermediary factor 2 and found that GRV575M transcriptional activity was not enhanced by GRIP1 in transfected cells nor was it able to bind GRIP1 in vitro. Identification of the novel GRV575M variant in human bronchial epithelial cells using a molecular genetic selection scheme suggests that functional assays performed in relevant cell types could identify subtle defects in GR signaling that contribute to reduced steroid sensitivities in vivo.
12925531	A novel mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition involving interactions with Ser-530 and Tyr-385.	A variety of drugs inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 by the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases. Several modes of inhibitor binding in the COX active site have been described including ion pairing of carboxylic acid containing inhibitors with Arg-120 of COX-1 and COX-2 and insertion of arylsulfonamides and sulfones into the COX-2 side pocket. Recent crystallographic evidence suggests that Tyr-385 and Ser-530 chelate polar or negatively charged groups in arachidonic acid and aspirin. We tested the generality of this binding mode by analyzing the action of a series of COX inhibitors against site-directed mutants of COX-2 bearing changes in Arg-120, Tyr-355, Tyr-348, and Ser-530. Interestingly, diclofenac inhibition was unaffected by the mutation of Arg-120 to alanine but was dramatically attenuated by the S530A mutation. Determination of the crystal structure of a complex of diclofenac with murine COX-2 demonstrates that diclofenac binds to COX-2 in an inverted conformation with its carboxylate group hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-385 and Ser-530. This finding represents the first experimental demonstration that the carboxylate group of an acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug can bind to a COX enzyme in an orientation that precludes the formation of a salt bridge with Arg-120. Mutagenesis experiments suggest Ser-530 is also important in time-dependent inhibition by nimesulide and piroxicam.
12935323	Beneficial effects of fish liver preparations of sea bass (Lates calcarifer) versus gemfibrozil in high fat diet-induced lipid-intolerant rats.	Abnormal lipid metabolism is a main cause of dyslipidemia, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and obesity and is even linked to diabetic-dyslipidemic complications. Fifteen days of high-fat feeding in Charles Foster rats resulted in a significant increase in baseline serum lipid levels accompanied by pronounced dyslipidemia. Treatment with fish liver preparations (FLPs) from sea bass and the standard drug gemfibrozil produced a lowering of serum lipids and glucose levels, along with a fall in very-low-density and low-density lipoprotein and an increase in high-density lipoprotein levels. Simultaneously, reactivation of plasma postheparin lipolytic activity (PHLA) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was also observed. A positive correlation was observed between low-density lipoprotein activity and fecal bile acid excretion, which was enhanced on treatment with FLPs and gemfibrozil, indicating the catabolic process for normal lipids and cholesterol homeostasis. These data suggest that FLPs and gemfibrozil not only lower lipid intolerance but also reduce diabetic-dyslipidemic complications by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR).
12955149	Structure of the catalytic domain of human phosphodiesterase 5 with bound drug molecules.	Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of enzymes that degrade the intracellular second messengers cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. As essential regulators of cyclic nucleotide signalling with diverse physiological functions, PDEs are drug targets for the treatment of various diseases, including heart failure, depression, asthma, inflammation and erectile dysfunction. Of the 12 PDE gene families, cGMP-specific PDE5 carries out the principal cGMP-hydrolysing activity in human corpus cavernosum tissue. It is well known as the target of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) and other similar drugs for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Despite the pressing need to develop selective PDE inhibitors as therapeutic drugs, only the cAMP-specific PDE4 structures are currently available. Here we present the three-dimensional structures of the catalytic domain (residues 537-860) of human PDE5 complexed with the three drug molecules sildenafil, tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra). These structures will provide opportunities to design potent and selective PDE inhibitors with improved pharmacological profiles.
12956733	Bicarbonate-dependent depolarizing potentials in pyramidal cells and interneurons during epileptiform activity.	Experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that GABAergic neurotransmission is fundamental for the synchronization of neuronal activity. In particular, the role of GABA in epileptiform activity has received increased attention due to, among others, the fact that the GABA-mediated potentials can be depolarizing, and hence excitatory, in some circumstances. Evidence is presented here that bicarbonate efflux via GABAA receptors in interneurons and pyramidal cells of the CA1 hippocampal area contribute to depolarizing GABAA-mediated potentials in an in vitro nonpharmacological seizure-like model of status epilepticus. Seizure-like and interictal activity was evoked in rat horizontal hippocampal slices using a superfusing solution with low magnesium concentration (0.5-0.9 mm). Whole-cell recordings from stratum oriens-alveus interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cells revealed that, during epileptiform activity, some GABAA-mediated potentials were depolarizing, and were suppressed by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide as well as by the GABAA-receptor antagonist bicuculline. These observations indicate that the depolarizing potentials observed during epileptiform activity reflect both glutamatergic and GABAA-receptor-mediated activity, and adds further support for the important role of GABAergic interneurons in promoting long-range synchronization.
12970106	Agonist actions of dihydroergotamine at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors and their possible relevance to antimigraine efficacy.	1. The pharmaceutical compound, dihydroergotamine (DHE) is dispensed to prevent and reduce the occurrence of migraine attacks. Although still controversial, the prophylactic effect of this drug is believed to be caused through blockade and/or activation of numerous receptors including serotonin (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT2 subtype. 2. To elucidate if 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) may be involved in DHE prophylactic effect, we performed investigations aimed to determine the respective pharmacological profile of DHE and of its major metabolite 8'-hydroxy-DHE (8'-OH-DHE) at the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2CRs by binding, inositol triphosphate (IP3) or cyclic GMP (cGMP) coupling studies in transfected fibroblasts. 3. DHE and 8'-OH-DHE are competitive compounds at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2CRs. 8'-OH-DHE interaction at (5-HT2BRs) was best fitted by a biphasic competition curve and displayed the highest affinity with a Ki of 5 nm. These two compounds acted as agonists for both receptors in respect to cGMP production with pEC50 of 8.32+/-0.09 for 8'-OH-DHE at 5-HT2B and 7.83+/-0.06 at 5-HT2CRs. 4. Knowing that the antimigraine prophylactic effect of DHE is only observed after long-term treatment, we chronically exposed the recombinant cells to DHE and 8'-OH-DHE. The number of 5-HT2BR-binding sites was always more affected than 5-HT2CRs. At 5-HT2BRs, 8'-OH-DHE was more effective than DHE, with an uncoupling that persisted for more than 40 h for IP3 or cGMP. By contrast, the 5-HT2CR coupling was reversible after either treatment. 5. Chronic exposure to 8'-OH-DHE caused a persistent agonist-mediated desensitisation of 5-HT2B, but not 5-HT2CRs. This may be of relevance to therapeutic actions of the compound.
12970383	Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase substrates potentiate hydralazine hypotension: possible role of hydrogen peroxide.	The relation between inhibition of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) and vasodilation by hydralazine (HYD) was evaluated in chloralose/urethane-anesthetized rats pretreated with various substrates of the enzyme and subsequently administered a threshold hypotensive dose of the vasodilator. The SSAO substrates benzylamine, phenethylamine, and methylamine potentiate the hypotensive response to HYD. Methylamine, which was studied in greater detail because of its status as a possible endogenous SSAO substrate, does not influence the response to the reference vasodilator pinacidil; it does enhance HYD relaxation in aortic rings obtained from pretreated rats. Experiments designed to identify the product of SSAO activity responsible for potentiation by methylamine suggest involvement of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as evidenced by the findings that such potentiation is abolished by additional pretreatment with the H2O2-metabolizing enzyme catalase, and that the plasma concentration of H2O2 is increased by methylamine and decreased by HYD. These results are interpreted as a substantiation of the relation between the known SSAO inhibitory effect of HYD and its vasodilator activity. Pretreatment with the SSAO substrates would increase production of H2O2 in vascular smooth muscle and thus magnify the influence of this vasoconstrictor agent on vascular tone. In these conditions, the decrease in H2O2 production and hence in vascular tone caused by SSAO inhibition by HYD would also be magnified. It is speculated that inhibition of vascular SSAO could represent a novel mechanism of vasodilation.
1311390	Two independent amsacrine-resistant human myeloid leukemia cell lines share an identical point mutation in the 170 kDa form of human topoisomerase II.	Cloning and sequencing of cDNA segments of human TOP2 gene encoding the 170 kDa form of human DNA topoisomerase II show that Arg486 of the enzyme has been mutated to a lysine in the enzyme from two human leukemia cell lines HL-60/AMSA and KBM-3/AMSA, which were independently selected for resistance to the antitumor drug amsacrine (4'-[9-acridinylamino]-methanesulfon-m-anisidide, mAMSA). Sequence identity comparisons between eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II and bacterial gyrase (bacterial DNA topoisomerase II) indicate that the position of the common mutation observed in mAMSA-resistant human TOP2 corresponds to that of the point mutation nal-31 in the Escherichia coli gyrase B gene, which confers resistance to nalidixic acid. Because mAMSA and nalidixic acid are known to act on their respective targets by a common mechanism of trapping the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediates, these results provide strong evidence that the 170 kDa form of human DNA topoisomerase II is a major cellular target of mAMSA, and that Arg486 of this enzyme is involved in mAMSA-mediated trapping of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex.
13129658	Schizophrenia is not associated with DRD4 48-base-pair-repeat length or individual alleles: results of a meta-analysis.	The gene DRD4, coding for dopamine receptor D4, was considered a candidate for association with schizophrenia based on its upregulation in postmortem schizophrenic brain and affinity for clozapine. Many studies sought allelic association of a 48-base-pair repeat in DRD4 exon 3 with schizophrenia, but found no strong evidence for a relationship. The present work sought to determine if this observation reflected the true absence of association or the low power of individual studies.
1320691	Disulfiram and diethyldithiocarbamate are competitive inhibitors at the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.	In the present study in vitro interactions of disulfiram (an agent used to induce ethanol intolerance in alcoholics), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), and metronidazole with central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors (PBR) were investigated in rat tissues. Disulfiram displaced specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 from PBR in the cerebral cortex with an IC50 value of 5 x 10(-7) M. The binding of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 to PBR in the kidney was displaced by disulfiram with IC50 values of 7 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-7) M, respectively. DDC displaced [3H]PK 11195 binding to kidney membranes with an IC50 value of 5 x 10(-5) M. Binding of [3H] flunitrazepam to CBR in the cerebral cortex was not affected by either disulfiram or DDC. Metronidazole (up to 10(-4) M), a disulfiram congener, did not affect [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) and [3H] PK 11195 binding to CBR and PBR, respectively. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PK 11195 binding to kidney membranes, performed in the absence or presence of 7 x 10(-7) M disulfiram, decreased ligand affinity without influencing the maximal number of binding sites, suggesting a competitive inhibition. Beta-Mercaptoethanol (2 x 10(-2) M), which blocks the inhibitory activity of disulfiram and DDC at the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, did not affect the inhibitory potency of disulfiram at the kidney PBR. Removal of disulfiram from kidney by repeated washing with Tris-HCl buffer resulted in the restoration of binding properties to control values, suggesting reversibility of disulfiram binding to PBR.
1323650	S 14671: a naphtylpiperazine 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonist of exceptional potency and high efficacy possessing antagonist activity at 5-hydroxytryptamine1C/2 receptors.	The interaction at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors of the novel naphtylpiperazine, S 14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)ethyl]-4[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine), was compared to that of the 5-HT1A ligands, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT), WY 50,324 [N-(29(4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)tricyclo(3.3.1.1(3,7) )- decane-1-carboxamide], (+)-flesinoxan, buspirone and BMY 7378 [(8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol[-4-]-decane-7,9-dione 2HCl]. S 14671 showed a very high affinity for 5-HT1A sites (pKi, 9.3) as compared to the reference ligands (pKi values, 9.2, 8.7, 8.7, 7.9 and 8.7, respectively). S 14671 bound in an apparently competitive manner and, in distinction to the reference compounds, possessed a Hill Coefficient (1.4) significantly superior to 1. Although showing low affinity at 5-HT1B and 5-HT3 sites, S 14671 displayed significant affinity at both 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites; pKi, 7.8 in each case. Furthermore, S 14671 acted as an antagonist of 5-HT-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in rat choroid plexus (5-HT1C) and cortex (5-HT2). In vivo, upon s.c. administration, S 14671 acted as a high efficacy agonist in models of 5-HT1A receptor-mediated activity: induction of flat-body posture, spontaneous tail-flicks, hypothermia and corticosterone secretion and inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception. In every test, S 14671 was the most potent compound: it was active at doses as low as 5 micrograms/kg s.c. Relative potency across all tests was S 14671 greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than WY 50,324 greater than (+)-flesinoxan greater than buspirone with BMY 7378 too weak for comparison to be meaningful. The action of S 14671 in 5-HT1A tests was blocked by BMY 7378 and the 5-HT1A antagonist, (-)-alprenolol, but unaffected by the 5-HT1C/2 antagonist, ritanserin, and the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron. Activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors was confirmed in 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-lesioned rats, in which the potency of S 14671 to elicit spontaneous tail-flicks was potentiated. Activation of presynaptic receptors was demonstrated by inhibition of the electrical activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus with the following order of relative potency: S 14671 greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than WY 50,324 greater than BMY 7378 greater than buspirone. Spiperone, which acts as a pure 5-HT1A antagonist at raphe 5-HT1A receptors, blocked the action of S 14671. In conclusion, S 14671 is a structurally novel ligand manifesting high efficacy and exceptional potency at both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1324091	5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists for the abortive treatment of vascular headaches block mast cell, endothelial and platelet activation within the rat dura mater after trigeminal stimulation.	Antidromic stimulation of small caliber trigeminal axons causes neurogenic inflammation in the dura mater and tongue as evidenced by marked increases in mast cell activation, protein extravasation, as well as in the numbers of endothelial cytoplasmic vesicles, endothelial microvilli and platelet aggregates within ipsilateral post-capillary venules. In this report, we examined the effects of pretreatment with serotonin1 receptor agonists, dihydroergotamine (50 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and sumatriptan (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) on the light and electron microscopic changes which develop after trigeminal ganglion stimulation. Both dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan are useful in the acute treatment of vascular headaches and bind with high affinity to 5-HT1D receptors. Both drugs decreased significantly the number of dural vessels showing endothelial or platelet changes and the numbers of activated mast cells, but did not affect the neurogenic response in the tongue. The drugs also blocked the accumulation of horseradish peroxidase reaction product within the endothelium and perivascular space on the stimulated side. The receptor is not present on trigeminovascular fibers innervating extracranial cephalic tissues. Drug mechanism probably involves inhibition of a proximal step in the pathophysiological cascade (e.g., via activation of a prejunctional receptor) because (a) receptors for sumatriptan have not been identified on mast cells whereas the inflammatory response was attenuated in mast cells as well as within platelets and the endothelium and (b) previous work indicates that sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine block neurotransmitter release. Hence, constriction of vascular smooth muscle mediated by postjunctional 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors is unlikely to explain the anti-inflammatory actions of dihydroergotamine or sumatriptan reported here.
13679187	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of ambenonium derivatives as AChE inhibitors.	Ambenonium (1), an old AChE inhibitor, is endowed with an outstanding affinity and a peculiar mechanism of action that, taken together, make it a very promising pharmacological tool for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unfortunately, the bisquaternary structure of 1 prevents its passage through the blood brain barrier. In a search of centrally active ambenonium derivatives, we planned to synthesize tertiary amines of 1, such as 2 and 3. In addition, to add new insights into the binding mechanism of the inhibitor, we designed constrained analogues of ambenonium by incorporating the diamine functions into cyclic moieties (4-12). The biological evaluation of the new compounds has been assessed in vitro against human AChE and BChE. All tertiary amine derivatives resulted more than 1000-fold less potent than 1 and, unlike prototype, did not show any selectivity between the two enzymes. This result, because of recent findings concerning the role of BChE in AD, makes our compounds, endowed with a well-balanced profile of AChE/BChE inhibition, valuable candidates for further development. To better clarify the interactions that account for the high affinity of 1, docking simulations and molecular dynamics studies on the AChE-1 complex were also carried out.
1378042	Effect of NZ-107, a newly synthesized pyridazinone derivative, on antigen-induced contraction of human bronchial strips and histamine release from human lung fragments or leukocytes.	The effects of a newly synthesized pyridazinone derivative, NZ-107, 4-bromo-5-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxybenzylamino)-3(2H)-pyridazinone, and two well-known antiasthmatic drugs, amlexanox (orally active disodium cromoglycate-like drug) and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) on antigen-, histamine- and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)-induced constriction of isolated human tracheal muscle, and histamine release from human lung tissues and leukocytes were investigated in vitro. In some experiments, salbutamol was used as a reference drug. NZ-107 inhibited antigen-, histamine- and LTC4-induced contraction of tracheal muscle. Amlexanox and DSCG did not affect the contractile response of tracheal muscle caused by each stimulant. Salbutamol inhibited antigen-induced contraction of tracheal muscle. NZ-107, amlexanox, DSCG and salbutamol clearly inhibited the antigen-induced release of histamine and LTC4 from human lung tissue. The antigen-induced histamine release from atopic human leukocytes was inhibited by NZ-107 and amlexanox, but not by DSCG. Pretreatment with IL-3 did not alter antigen-induced contraction of tracheal muscle and histamine release from lung tissue, but antigen- or calcium ionophore A 23187-induced histamine release from leukocytes was clearly enhanced. Amlexanox inhibited the IL-3-induced enhancement of histamine release from leukocytes in the case of both stimuli, but NZ-107 and DSCG had no effect. These data suggest that NZ-107 has potent anti-allergic actions based on the inhibition of antigen-induced contraction of human tracheal muscle and mediator release from human lung tissue and leukocytes.
1382157	Alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II pressor sensitivity in hypertensive patients treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.	We investigated pressor sensitivity to infused phenylephrine (PE), 0.05 to 0.4 micrograms/kg/min, and angiotensin II (Ang II), 2.5 to 10 ng/kg/min, in 35 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, before and at the end of a 4-week treatment period with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril, 2.5 or 5.0 mg/day. Cilazapril lowered the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10.6/3.5 mm Hg, but had no effect on the dose-response curves of dose of PE or Ang II vs. the increase in systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure, or heart rate. There were also no significant effects of cilazapril on PD20 values, i.e., the dose of PE or Ang II required to increase mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 20 mm Hg, or on delta R-R/delta MAP (ratio of the increase of the ECG R-R interval to the increase in mean arterial blood pressure) as a measure of baroreflex sensitivity. Plasma renin activity was significantly increased by cilazapril therapy, but there were no changes in plasma concentrations of Ang II or atrial natriuretic factor. We conclude that cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor, does not alter alpha 1-adrenoceptor and Ang II receptor sensitivity to selective agonists, nor does it affect baroreflex sensitivity.
1382161	Renal effects of angiotensin II in normotensive subjects on short-term cilazapril treatment.	In 13 normotensive subjects on a normal sodium diet, we studied renal vascular, blood pressure, and hormonal changes induced by infusion of exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) (5 ng/kg/min) during baseline conditions and after 5 days of cilazapril administration. In both conditions, Ang II elicited a slight pressor response accompanied by renal hemodynamic and hormonal changes that were similar. This suggests that hourly changes in Ang II concentrations and/or in Ang II receptor density after short-term administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril does not significantly affect renal vascular reactivity. In addition, these results also indirectly suggest that most of the renal effects of ACE inhibition are mediated through suppression of Ang II formation.
1407010	"5-HT1R" or 5-HT1D sites? Evidence for 5-HT1D binding sites in rabbit brain.	Radioligand binding studies were performed in membranes of rabbit whole brain and striatum using the novel iodinated radioligand for 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D sites, Serotonin-5-O-Carboxymethyl-Glycyl[125I]Tyrosinamide ([125I]GTI). [125I]GTI labelled a finite number of high affinity sites in rabbit brain membranes, Bmax = 191 +/- 47 fmol/mg protein, pKD (-log mol/l) = 8.50 +/- 0.13, n = 5. The pharmacological profile of [125I]GTI binding was fully comparable to that reported previously in human and other brain preparations known to possess 5-HT1D sites (using either [3H]5-HT or [125I]GTI) and displayed a characteristic rank order of affinity: 5-carboxamido-tryptamine greater than 5-HT = dihydroergotamine greater than or equal to ergotamine greater than or equal to sumatriptan greater than or equal to CGS 12066 greater than or equal to metergoline greater than yohimbine greater than or equal to methysergide greater than ICYP greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than or equal to CP 93129 greater than (-)pindolol greater than ketanserin greater than isamoltane greater than mesulergine greater than corynanthine greater than buspirone greater than MDL 72222. Autoradiographic studies were performed on rabbit brain slices using [3H]5-HT in the presence of 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT and mesulergine (in order to mask 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C binding sites) and [125I]CYP (iodocyanopindolol) in the presence of 3 mumol/l isoprenaline and 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT (in order to mask beta adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A binding sites). There was no detectable specific binding of [125I]CYP through the brain, thus excluding the presence of 5-HT1B sites in rabbit brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1424804	Localization of the human GM-CSF receptor beta chain gene (CSF2RB) to chromosome 22q12.2-->q13.1.	The gene for the beta-chain of the human GM-CSF receptor (CSF2RB) has been mapped to chromosome 22 by PCR analysis of a series of human x rodent somatic cell hybrids. In situ hybridization to normal human chromosomes and two translocations involving chromosome 22 and the chromosome expressing the rare fragile site FRA22A place the gene in the region 22q12.2-->q13.1, proximal to the fragile site.
1426023	Stereoselective interaction of procyclidine, hexahydro-difenidol, hexbutinol and oxyphencyclimine, and of related antagonists, with four muscarinic receptors.	We investigated the binding properties of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the muscarinic antagonists trihexyphenidyl, procyclidine, hexahydro-difenidol, p-fluoro-hexahydro-difenidol, hexbutinol, p-fluoro-hexbutinol, and their corresponding methiodides at muscarinic M1, M2, M3 and M4 receptor subtypes. In addition, binding properties of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of oxyphencyclimine were studied. The (R)- enantiomers (eutomers) of all the compounds had a greater affinity than the (S)-isomers for the four muscarinic receptor subtypes. The binding patterns of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers were generally different. We did not observe any general correlation between the potency of the high-affinity enantiomer and the affinity ratio (eudismic ratio) of the two enantiomers. The results are discussed in terms of a 'four subsites' binding model.
14504136	Pharmacological profile of the 5-HT-induced inhibition of cardioaccelerator sympathetic outflow in pithed rats: correlation with 5-HT1 and putative 5-ht5A/5B receptors.	Continuous infusions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) inhibit the tachycardiac responses to preganglionic (C7-T1) sympathetic stimulation in pithed rats pretreated with desipramine. The present study identified the pharmacological profile of this inhibitory action of 5-HT. The inhibition induced by intravenous (i.v.) continuous infusions of 5-HT (5.6 microg x kg-1x min-1) on sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses remained unaltered after i.v. treatment with saline or the antagonists GR 127935 (5-HT1B/1D), the combination of WAY 100635 (5-HT1A) plus GR 127935, ritanserin (5-HT2), tropisetron (5-HT3/4), LY215840 (5-HT7) or a cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors consisting of yohimbine (alpha2), prazosin (alpha1), ritanserin, GR 127935, WAY 100635 and indomethacin (cyclooxygenase), but was abolished by methiothepin (5-HT1/2/6/7 and recombinant 5-ht5A/5B). These drugs, used in doses high enough to block their respective receptors/mechanisms, did not modify the sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses per se. I.v. continuous infusions of the agonists 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT; 5-HT1/7 and recombinant 5-ht5A/5B), CP 93129 (r5-HT1B), sumatriptan (5-HT1B/1D), PNU-142633 (5-HT1D) and ergotamine (5-HT1B/1D and recombinant 5-ht5A/5B) mimicked the above sympatho-inhibition to 5-HT. In contrast, the agonists indorenate (5-HT1A) and LY344864 (5-ht1F) were inactive. Interestingly, 5-CT-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition was abolished by methiothepin, the cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors, GR 127935 or the combination of SB224289 (5-HT1B) plus BRL15572 (5-HT1D), but remained unchanged when SB224289 or BRL15572 were given separately. Therefore, 5-HT-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition, being unrelated to 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-ht6, 5-HT7 receptors, alpha1/2-adrenoceptor or prostaglandin synthesis, seems to be primarily mediated by (i). 5-HT1 (probably 5-HT1B/1D) receptors and (ii). a novel mechanism antagonized by methiothepin that, most likely, involves putative 5-ht5A/5B receptors.
14510637	Detergents profoundly affect inhibitor potencies against both cyclo-oxygenase isoforms.	The sensitivity of Coxs (cyclo-oxygenases) to inhibition is known to be highly dependent on assay conditions. In the present study, the inhibitor sensitivities of purified Cox-1 and -2 were determined in a colorimetric assay using the reducing agent N, N, N ', N '-tetramethyl- p -phenylenediamine. With the detergent genapol X-100 (2 mM) present, the potencies of nimesulide, ibuprofen, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid and naproxen were increased over 100-fold against Cox-2 and titration curve shapes changed, so that maximal inhibition now approached 100%. Indomethacin, diclofenac and flosulide were not changed in potency. Similar effects of genapol were observed with inhibitors of Cox-1. DuP-697 and two analogues became more than 10-fold less potent against Cox-2 with genapol present. Tween-20, Triton X-100 and phosphatidylcholine, but not octylglucoside, gave qualitatively similar effects as genapol. Similar detergent-dependent changes in inhibitor potency were also observed using a [(14)C]arachidonic acid HPLC assay. The increases in potency of ibuprofen, flufenamic acid, isoxicam and niflumic acid towards Cox-2 and ibuprofen towards Cox-1 were accompanied by a change from time-independent to time-dependent inhibition. The interactions of Cox inhibitors has been described in terms of multiple binding step mechanisms. The genapol-dependent increase in inhibitor potency for ketoprofen was associated with an increase in the rate constant for the conversion of the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex to a second, more tightly bound form. The loss of potency for some inhibitors is probably due to inhibitor partitioning into detergent micelles. The present study identifies detergents as another factor that must be considered when determining inhibitor potencies against both Cox isoforms.
14513718	Effects of steroidal and non steroidal drugs on the neovascularization response induced by tumoral TA3 supernatant on CAM from chick embryo.	Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from the existing vascular network, may result as a consequence of the increase or decrease of proangiogenic or antiangiogenic factors, respectively. The tumor itself could up-regulate the production of angiogenic factors. Recently, we established that the steroidal drug betamethasone in low concentration inhibit the neovascularization promoted by TA3 Ts on CAM of chick embryos. We describe here the effects of the non-steroidal drug ketoprofen, alone or in association with betamethasone, on the angiogenesis promoted by TA3 Ts on CAM. The main finding reported here is that the formation of new blood vessels is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of ketoprofen. The association of both drugs produced a synergistic effect, significantly decreasing tumoral supernatant angiogenesis. It is known that steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the enzymes required for the production of prostaglandins through a nuclear GR mediated mechanism. This may operate as a general mechanism in endothelial cells as well. Considering that the induction of COX 1 and COX2 are inhibited by ketoprofen, and that these enzymes are located in the stromal compartment of the CAM, we propose that its antiangiogenic effect may occur via inhibition of the two COX isoforms. In fact, we found that ketoprofen induced apoptosis in both the stromal fibroblast and endothelial cells. The potentiated effect of the combination of betamethasone and ketoprofen may have some therapeutic projections in the control of pathological angiogenesis.
14515341	High-dose fenfluramine administration decreases serotonin transporter binding, but not serotonin transporter protein levels, in rat forebrain.	Administration of D-fenfluramine (D-FEN) or parachloroamphetamine (PCA) can produce long-lasting decreases in serotonin transporter (SERT) binding and tissue levels of serotonin (5-HT) in rat forebrain. These changes have been viewed as evidence for 5-HT neurotoxicity, but no studies have measured SERT protein levels. In the present study, we determined the effect of high-dose D-FEN or PCA, administered according to a "neurotoxic" dosing regimen, on the density of SERT sites using ligand binding methods and on SERT protein levels using Western blots. Rats were sacrificed 2 days and 2 weeks after administration of drug or saline. The density of SERT was determined in homogenates of caudate and whole brain minus caudate. D-FEN and PCA decreased SERT binding by 30-60% in both tissues and at both time points. Similarly, D-FEN and PCA administration profoundly decreased tissue 5-HT and 5-HIAA in frontal cortex. Despite the large decreases in SERT binding and depletion of tissue 5-HT that occurred with D-FEN administration, SERT protein expression, as determined by Western blot analysis, did not change in either tissue or time point. PCA administration decreased SERT protein by about 20% only at the 2-day point in the caudate. Drug treatments did not change expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a hallmark indicator of neuronal damage, in whole brain minus caudate in the 2-week group. These results support the hypothesis that decreases in tissue 5-HT and SERT binding sites induced by D-FEN and PCA reflect neuroadaptive changes, rather than neurotoxic effects.
14534310	Structures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) aminotransferase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing enzyme, complexed with gamma-ethynyl-GABA and with the antiepilepsy drug vigabatrin.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme responsible for the degradation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. GABA-AT is a validated target for antiepilepsy drugs because its selective inhibition raises GABA concentrations in brain. The antiepilepsy drug, gamma-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin) has been investigated in the past by various biochemical methods and resulted in several proposals for its mechanisms of inactivation. In this study we solved and compared the crystal structures of pig liver GABA-AT in its native form (to 2.3-A resolution) and in complex with vigabatrin as well as with the close analogue gamma-ethynyl-GABA (to 2.3 and 2.8 A, respectively). Both inactivators form a covalent ternary adduct with the active site Lys-329 and the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The crystal structures provide direct support for specific inactivation mechanisms proposed earlier on the basis of radio-labeling experiments. The reactivity of GABA-AT crystals with the two GABA analogues was also investigated by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry. The spectral data are discussed in relation to the proposed mechanism. Intriguingly, all three structures revealed a [2Fe-2S] cluster of yet unknown function at the center of the dimeric molecule in the vicinity of the PLP cofactors.
14534362	Site of action of the general anesthetic propofol in muscarinic M1 receptor-mediated signal transduction.	Although a potential target site of general anesthetics is primarily the GABA A receptor, a chloride ion channel, a previous study suggested that the intravenous general anesthetic propofol attenuates the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 receptor)-mediated signal transduction. In the present study, we examined the target site of propofol in M1 receptor-mediated signal transduction. Two-electrode voltage-clamp method was used in Xenopus oocytes expressing both M1 receptors and associated G protein alpha subunits (Gqalpha). Propofol inhibited M1 receptor-mediated signal transduction in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 50 nM). Injection of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) into oocytes overexpressing Gqalpha was used to investigate direct effects of propofol on G protein coupled with the M1 receptor. Propofol did not affect activation of Gqalpha-mediated signal transduction with the intracellular injection of GTPgammaS. We also studied effects of propofol on l-[N-methyl-3H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]NMS) binding and M1 receptor-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells expressing M1 receptor. Propofol inhibited the M1 receptor-mediated signal transduction but did not inhibit binding of [3H]NMS. Effects of propofol on Gs- and Gi/o-coupled signal transduction were investigated, using oocytes expressing the beta2 adrenoceptor (beta2 receptor)/cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or oocytes expressing the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor)/Kir3.1 (a member of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels). Neither beta2 receptor-mediated nor M2 receptor-mediated signal transduction was inhibited by a relatively high concentration of propofol (50 microM). These results indicate that propofol inhibits M1 receptor-mediated signal transduction by selectively disrupting interaction between the receptor and associated G protein.
14550679	In vivo activity of bupropion at the human dopamine transporter as measured by positron emission tomography.	Converging lines of evidence are consistent with an inhibitory effect of the antidepressant and smoking-cessation aid bupropion on dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, but the in vivo effects of the drug at the human dopamine transporter (DAT) have not been studied to date. This study employed positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the extent and duration of DAT receptor occupancy by bupropion and its metabolites under conditions of steady-state oral dosing with bupropion sustained-release (SR) in healthy volunteers.
14568028	Intraplantar injection of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor ketorolac reduces immunoreactivities of substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and dynorphin in the dorsal horn of rats with nerve injury or inflammation.	We previously reported that partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) dramatically up-regulates cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in injured sciatic nerve, and local injection of the COX inhibitor, ketorolac, reverses tactile allodynia and suppresses increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein [Eur J Neurosci 15 (2002) 1037]. These findings suggest that peripheral prostaglandins (PGs) are over-produced and contribute to the central plasticity and the maintenance of neuropathic pain after nerve injury. PGs, particularly PGE2, are well known to facilitate the release of the pro-nociceptive neuropeptide substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from primary sensory afferents. Thus, suppressing peripheral PG over-production may inhibit the release of these two neuropeptides from primary afferents and thereby increase the content of these neuropeptides remaining in afferent terminals in the dorsal horn. In this study we tested this hypothesis by examining the immunoreactivities of SP and CGRP in the dorsal horn of PSNL rats intraplantarly injected with saline and ketorolac. Four weeks after PSNL, SP- and CGRP-immunoreactivities (IR) in the ipsilateral dorsal horn were not significantly different from the contralateral side. Five days following intraplantar injection of ketorolac, CGRP- and SP-IR in the ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal horn were dramatically reduced compared with saline-injected PSNL rats. Local ketorolac also suppressed PSNL-induced increase in dynorphin-IR in dorsal horn neurons. Since abundant production of PGs during inflammation is well documented, we further examined the effect of intraplantar ketorolac on neuropeptide expression in the dorsal horn following carrageenan inflammation. We observed that co-administration of ketorolac with carrageenan in the hindpaw also reduced SP- and dynorphin-IR in the ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal horn. These findings are in contrast to our hypothesis, suggesting that peripherally over-produced PGs following nerve injury and inflammation possibly contribute to the production of SP and CGRP in primary sensory neurons, to the up-regulation of dynorphin in the dorsal horn neurons, and finally to the mechanisms of neuropathic and inflammation pain.
14568029	Cyclooxygenase 2 in infiltrating inflammatory cells in injured nerve is universally up-regulated following various types of peripheral nerve injury.	We previously reported the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in injured sciatic nerve of rats with partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) and the reversal of PSNL-elicited tactile allodynia by local injection of the COX inhibitor ketorolac [Eur J Neurosci 15 (2002) 1037]. We further asked whether COX2 up-regulation in injured nerve is a universal phenomenon following various types of nerve injury. In the current study, we observed that abundant COX2 immunoreactive (IR) cell profiles appeared in injured nerves of rats following spinal nerve ligation (SNL), chronic constriction injury (CCI) and complete sciatic nerve transection. Most COX2-IR cells were identified as infiltrating macrophages. Partial injury induced greater COX2 up-regulation than complete injury. COX2 up-regulation reached a peak at 2-4 weeks, evidently declined by 3 months and disappeared by 7 months postlesion. These findings suggest that up-regulation of COX2 in injured nerve is a common event during the initial several months after nerve injury. We observed that local ketorolac-elicited anti-allodynia was closely associated with the abundance of COX2-IR cells in injured nerve, varying with the type of injury and time after injury. The anti-allodynia lasted the longest when local ketorolac was given 2-4 weeks after PSNL, CCI and SNL. The duration of local ketorolac's anti-allodynia was the longest in CCI rats, which also exhibited the most abundant COX2 up-regulation. Local ketorolac's anti-allodynia lasted much shorter when given 2-3 months after lesion. Local ketorolac failed to induce anti-allodynia 7 months after lesion, a time when COX2-IR cells completely disappeared from the injured nerve except a few cells at the injury site. Our data strongly suggest that during the initial several months after nerve injury, peripherally over-produced prostaglandins play an important role in the maintenance of neuropathic pain.
14581123	Joint manipulation reduces hyperalgesia by activation of monoamine receptors but not opioid or GABA receptors in the spinal cord.	Joint manipulation has long been used for pain relief. However, the underlying mechanisms for manipulation-related pain relief remain largely unexplored. The purpose of the current study was to determine which spinal neurotransmitter receptors mediate manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia. Rats were injected with capsaicin (50 microl, 0.2%) into one ankle joint and mechanical withdrawal threshold measured before and after injection. The mechanical withdrawal threshold decreases 2 h after capsaicin injection. Two hours after capsaicin injection, the following drugs were administered intrathecally: bicuculline, blocks gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors; naloxone, blocks opioid receptors; yohimbine blocks, alpha2-adrenergic receptors; and methysergide, blocks 5-HT(1/2) receptors. In addition, NAN-190, ketanserin, and MDL-72222 were administered to selectively block 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT3 receptors, respectively. Knee joint manipulation was performed 15 min after administration of drug. The knee joint was flexed and extended to end range of extension while the tibia was simultaneously translated in an anterior to posterior direction. The treatment group received three applications of manipulation, each 3 min in duration separated by 1 min of rest. Knee joint manipulation after capsaicin injection into the ankle joint significantly increases the mechanical withdrawal threshold for 45 min after treatment. Spinal blockade of 5-HT(1/2) receptors with methysergide prevented, while blockade of alpha2-adrenergic receptors attenuated, the manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia. NAN-190 also blocked manipulation-induced antihyperalgesia suggesting that effects of methysergide are mediated by 5-HT1A receptor blockade. However, spinal blockade of opioid or GABAA receptors had no effect on manipulation induced-antihyperalgesia. Thus, the antihyperalgesia produced by joint manipulation appears to involve descending inhibitory mechanisms that utilize serotonin and noradrenaline.
14638394	Structure-activity relationship of neomycin, paromomycin, and neamine-arginine conjugates, targeting HIV-1 gp120-CXCR4 binding step.	We have recently designed and synthesized aminoglycoside-arginine conjugates (AACs) as potential anti-HIV-1 agents. AACs exert a number of activities related to Tat antagonism. We here present a new set of AACs, conjugates of neomycin B, paromomycin, and neamine with different number of arginines (1-6), their (a) uptake by human T-cell lines, (b) antiviral activities, (c) competition with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12G5 binding to CXCR4, (d) competition with stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1alpha) binding to CXCR4, and (e) competition with HIV-1 coat protein gp120 cell penetration. The appearance of mutations in HIV-1 gp120 gene in AACs resistant HIV-1 isolates, supports that AACs inhibit HIV-1 infectivity via interference of gp120-CXCR4 interaction. Our results point that the most potent AACs is the hexa-arginine-neomycin conjugate, the other multi-arginine-aminoglycoside conjugates are less active, and the mono-arginine conjugates display the lowest activity. Our studies demonstrate that, in addition to the core, the number of arginines attached to a specific aminoglycoside, are also important in the design of potent anti-HIV agents. The AACs play an important role, not only as HIV-1 RNA binders but also as inhibitors of viral entry into human cells.
14644446	Antagonism of botulinum toxin type A-induced cleavage of SNAP-25 in rat cerebral synaptosome by toosendanin.	Toosendanin (TSN), a triterpenoid derivative extracted from Chinese traditional medicine, has been demonstrated to be an effective cure for experimental botulism. This study is designed to explore its antibotulismic mechanism by Western blotting. The results showed that TSN incubation did not change the electrophoresis pattern and the amounts of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), syntaxin and synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein in rat cerebral synaptosomes, but made the synaptosomes completely resistant to botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A)-mediated cleavage of SNAP-25. After binding of BoNT/A to synaptosomes, TSN still partially antagonized the toxin-mediated cleavage of SNAP-25. However, TSN-incubated synaptosomal membrane fraction did not resist the cleavage of SNAP-25 by the light chain of BoNT/A. It is suggested that the antibotulismic effect of TSN results from blocking the toxin's approach to its enzymatic substrate.
14646172	New fluoroprostaglandin F(2alpha) derivatives with prostanoid FP-receptor agonistic activity as potent ocular-hypotensive agents.	To find new prostanoid FP-receptor agonists possessing potent ocular-hypotensive effects with minimal side effects, we evaluated the agonistic activities of newly synthesized prostaglandin F(2alpha) derivatives for the prostanoid FP-receptor both in vitro and in vivo. The iris constrictions induced by the derivatives and their effects on melanin content were examined using cat isolated iris sphincters and cultured B16 melanoma cells, respectively. The effects of derivative ester forms on miosis and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated in cats and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. Of these derivatives, 6 out of 12 compounds were more potent iris constrictors, with EC(50) values of 0.6 to 9.4 nM, than a carboxylic acid of latanoprost (EC(50)=13.6 nM). A carboxylic acid of latanoprost (100 microM) significantly increased the melanin content of cultured B16 melanoma cells, but some 15,15-difluoro derivatives, such as AFP-157 and AFP-172, did not. Topically applied AFP-168, AFP-169 and AFP-175 (isopropyl ester, methyl ester and ethyl ester forms, respectively, of AFP-172) induced miosis in cats more potently than latanoprost. AFP-168 (0.0005%) reduced IOP to the same extent as 0.005% latanoprost (for at least 8 h). These findings indicate that 15,15-difluoroprostaglandin F(2alpha) derivatives, especially AFP-168, have more potent prostanoid FP-receptor agonistic activities than latanoprost. Hence, AFP-168 may be worthy of further evaluation as an ocular-hypotensive agent.
14647959	Aripiprazole (OPC-14597) fully substitutes for the 5-HT1A receptor agonist LY293284 in the drug discrimination assay in rats.	Aripiprazole (OPC-14597) is a novel atypical antipsychotic drug with a low incidence of side effects. The therapeutic action of aripiprazole has been attributed to its unique agonist/antagonist effects at D(2) dopamine receptors; however, aripiprazole also has significant in vitro affinity at 5-HT(1A) receptors.

14664717	Determinants of spironolactone binding specificity in the mineralocorticoid receptor.	Spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist in clinical use. The compound has a very low affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Determinants of binding specificity of spironolactone to the MR were investigated using chimeras created between the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the MR and the GR. These chimeras had previously been used to investigate aldosterone binding specificity to the MR. Spironolactone was able to compete strongly for [(3)H]-aldosterone and [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera containing amino acids 804-874 of the MR, and weakly for [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera containing amino acids 672-803 of the MR. Amino acids 804-874 were also critical for aldosterone binding specificity. Models of the MR LBD bound to aldosterone and spironolactone were created based on the crystal structure of the progesterone receptor LBD. The ligand-binding pocket of the MR LBD model consisted of 23 amino acids and was predominantly hydrophobic in nature. Analysis of this model in light of the experimental data suggested that spironolactone binding specificity is not governed by amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket.
14674677	Characterization of the inhibitory effects of erythromycin and clarithromycin on the HERG potassium channel.	Both erythromycin and clarithromycin have been reported to cause QT prolongation and the cardiac arrhythmia torsade de pointes in humans, however direct evidence documenting that these drugs produce this effect by blocking human cardiac ion channels is lacking. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that these macrolide antibiotics significantly block the delayed rectifier current (IKr) encoded by HERG (the human ether-a-go-go-related gene) at drug concentrations, temperature and ionic conditions mimicking those occurring in human subjects. Potassium currents in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with HERG were recorded using a whole cell voltage clamp method. Exposure of cells to erythromycin reduced the HERG encoded potassium current in a concentration dependent manner with an IC50 of 38.9 +/- 1.2 microM and Hill Slope factor of 0.4 +/- 0.1. Clarithromycin produced a similar concentration-dependent block with an IC50 of 45.7 +/- 1.1 microM and Hill Slope factor of 1.0 +/- 0.1. Erythromycin (25-250 microM) and clarithromycin (5 or 25 microM) also produced a significant decrease in the integral of the current evoked by an action potential shaped voltage clamp protocol. The results of this study document that both erythromycin and clarithromycin significantly inhibit the HERG potassium current at clinically relevant concentrations.
14675103	The effect of the anorectic agent, d-fenfluramine, and its primary metabolite, d-norfenfluramine, on intact human platelet serotonin uptake and efflux.	Dexfenfluramine, a drug formerly prescribed for treatment of obesity, caused heart valve damage and pulmonary hypertension in some people. The cause of the toxicity has not been defined, but 5-HT has been implicated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the anorectic agent, d-fenfluramine, and its major metabolite, d-norfenfluramine, on intact human platelet serotonin (5-HT) transport in vitro. The effects of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine on platelet uptake and efflux of 3H-5-HT were measured in buffer at pH 6.7, to optimize serotonin transporter (SERT) function, and at pH 7.4. Uptake of 3H-5-HT at pH 6.7 and 7.4 was inhibited by both agents at micro m concentrations (IC50, d-fenfluramine approximately 3 microM; d-norfenfluramine approximately 10 microM). However, no efflux of 3H-5-HT from labeled platelets at either pH 6.7 or 7.4 occurred at similar concentrations of d-fenfluramine or d-norfenfluramine. With inhibition of platelet dense granule 3H-5-HT uptake by reserpine, efflux of 3H-5-HT was observed at pH 6, but not at pH 7.4. Fluoxetine, a SERT inhibitor, was a more potent inhibitor of uptake (IC50 0.05 microM) than d-fenfluramine, but the anorectic agent, phentermine, had no effect. Therefore, d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine inhibit human platelet uptake of 5-HT in vitro at tissue concentrations attainable in vivo, but they do not stimulate 5-HT efflux due to dense granule sequestration. Inhibition of platelet 5-HT uptake may play a role in the cardiopulmonary toxicity of d-fenfluramine, but other factors probably contribute, since similar toxicity has not been observed with fluoxetine.
14675762	Characterization of human circulating TIG2 as a ligand for the orphan receptor ChemR23.	The orphan receptor ChemR23 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with homology to neuropeptide and chemoattractant receptors. Tazarotene, a synthetic retinoid activating retinoic acid receptor (RAR), up-regulates tazarotene-induced gene-2 (TIG2). The function and molecular target of this protein are now described. By means of reverse pharmacology screening using a peptide library generated from human hemofiltrate, we have isolated and identified TIG2 as the natural ligand of ChemR23 and report the specific molecular form of the bioactive, circulating TIG2, representing the amino-acid residues 21 to 154 of the 163 amino acid-containing prepropeptide. Based on the expression pattern of ChemR23 and TIG2, the physiological role in bone development, immune and inflammatory responses and the maintenance of skin is now being investigated.
1468487	(-)-Penbutolol as a blocker of central 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses.	Brain 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors are important targets for drug-induced modulation of 5-HT function in vivo. However, very few compounds are available that are effective antagonists at 5-HT1 receptors, thus hampering the progress of fundamental as well as clinical research in this area. The present study assessed the usefulness of the beta-adrenolytic agent (-)-penbutolol (and its (+)-counterpart) as a 5-HT1A receptor-blocking agent. The compound was found to counteract, in a stereospecific fashion, not only the behavioural and hypothermic but also the in vivo 5-HT synthesis/turnover-reducing effects of the specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). These findings indicate that (-)-penbutolol is an antagonist at both postsynaptic receptors and somatodendritic autoreceptors of the 5-HT1A subtype. Thus, (-)-penbutolol represents a useful addition to the array of pharmacological tools available for the study of central 5-HT1 receptor-mediated functions.
14689449	Regulation of sphingomyelinases in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage.	Controversy exists regarding the nature of the "executioner" sphingomyelinase (SMase) in cells and its subcellular localization. A new fluorescence-based assay with the substrate 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-phosphorylcholine allowed rapid and reliable microassays of neutral (N) and acid (A) SMase activity in cell extracts from primary cultures of neonatal rat oligodendrocytes (OPC) and a human oligodendroglioma cell line (HOG). Total SMase activity was much higher in OPC than in HOG cells. Both staurosporine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced apoptosis and activated NSMase in a multiphasic manner in both OPC and HOG cells. The increase in caspase 8 activity preceded the 1 hr peak of NSMase activation, which was followed by caspase 3 activation. In contrast, ASMase activity, which constituted >90% of the total SMase activity, was unresponsive to proapoptotic drugs. Neither reducing ASMase levels by 50% by pretreatment with desipramine nor inhibiting sphingolipid synthesis by 50% with fumonisin B1 had any effect on cell death. Isolation of sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane microdomains (rafts) from the cells by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation revealed an enrichment of sphingomyelin, ceramide, and caspase 8. Proapoptotic drugs such as staurosporine promoted the translocation of NSMase to the raft fraction. In contrast, ASMase, other lysosomal hydrolases, and caspase 3 remained absent from rafts even after staurosporine treatment. The staurosporine-induced concomitant increase of ceramide in the raft fraction and caspase 3 in the cytosol could be mimicked by the addition of exogenous bacterial SMase. We conclude that caspase 8 activates NSMase in rafts in oligodendrocytes and that the downstream apoptotic signal is via caspase 3.

14716203	Bepridil block of recombinant human cardiac IKs current shows a time-dependent unblock.	Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were employed to examine the effects of bepridil, a Ca2+ channel blocker with Vaughan Williams class III action, on a slow component of cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs), which was reconstituted in HEK293 cells by transfecting KCNQ1 and KCNE1. Micromolar bepridil inhibited tail currents carried by KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 5.3 +/- 0.7 microM at -40 mV from 1000 milliseconds test pulse). When the effect of the drug was examined with a short test pulse protocol (250 milliseconds), IC50 became two-fold smaller than that measured with 1000 milliseconds test pulse (2.5 +/- 0.8 microM). The envelope-of-tails protocol was used to assess how the duration of depolarizing pulse affects the drug action on the outward KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel current. The drug significantly inhibited tail currents more potently during shorter pulses (<600 milliseconds). Bepridil's block was therefore time dependent, and its binding affinity to the channel was greater in the closed state channel, as evidenced by unblocking during prolonged depolarization. These properties of channel blockade appear to underscore the mechanism of bepridil's effect on IKs current.
14716205	Lesion progression in apoE-deficient mice: implication of chemokines and effect of the AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan.	We recently described that a treatment with the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan inhibits atherosclerotic lesion development, macrophage accumulation, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as the chemokine KC expression in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-deficient) mice. The present study addresses whether these and other chemokines are expressed not only during the initiation but also during the development of atherosclerotic lesions and whether irbesartan can inhibit the expression of these chemokines during lesion progression. The time course of lesion development was assessed in apoE-deficient mice aged 1 to 9 months and the relative expression of chemokines was quantified by RT-PCR. Significant lesion formation already appeared in 3-month-old apoE-deficient mice, and progressed further to the age of 9 months. The expression of MCP-1 and KC (the mouse homologue of Groalpha), was induced at 1 month in apoE-deficient as compared with wild type (C57/Bl6) mice, and was observed before any detectable histologic changes. MCP-1 and KC expression remained high during lesion progression. The expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2, the mouse Grobeta/gamma homologue) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) was increased in lesions from 4-month-old mice onward, whereas Regulated upon Activation of Normal T-cells Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) was significantly induced in 6- to 9-month-old mice only. Irbesartan (50 mg/kg/d) administered from the age of 3 months onward significantly reduced the progression of the lesions as well as the expression of the chemokines. A short-term treatment with irbesartan significantly inhibited the expression of MCP-1 and KC, suggesting that activation of the renin-angiotensin system is involved in up-regulation of these chemokines and that this effect represents a potential mechanism by which irbesartan inhibits plaque development and progression.
14726523	Protons activate the delta-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel in humans.	The amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) controls Na(+) transport into cells and across epithelia. So far, four homologous subunits of mammalian ENaC have been isolated and are denoted as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. ENaCdelta can associate with beta and gamma subunits and generate a constitutive current that is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of homomeric ENaCdelta. However, the distribution pattern of ENaCdelta is not consistent with that of the beta and gamma subunits. ENaCdelta is expressed mainly in the brain in contrast to beta and gamma subunits, which are expressed in non-neuronal tissues. To explain this discrepancy, we searched for novel functional properties of homomeric ENaCdelta and investigated the detailed tissue distribution in humans. When human ENaCdelta was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, a reduction of extracellular pH activated this channel (half-maximal pH for an activation of 5.0), and the acid-induced current was abolished by amiloride. The most striking finding was that the desensitization of the acid-evoked current was much slower (by approximately 10% 120 s later), dissociating from the kinetics of acid-sensing ion channels in the degenerin/epithelial Na(+) channel family, which were rapidly desensitized during acidification. RNA dot-blot analyses showed that ENaCdelta mRNA was widely distributed throughout the brain and was also expressed in the heart, kidney, and pancreas in humans. Northern blotting confirmed that ENaCdelta was expressed in the cerebellum and the hippocampus. In conclusion, human ENaCdelta activity is regulated by protons, indicating that it may contribute to the pH sensation and/or pH regulation in the human brain.
14728705	Naratriptan has a selective inhibitory effect on trigeminovascular neurones at central 5-HT1A and 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors in the cat: implications for migraine therapy.	The triptans are agonists at serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D receptors; however, they are also active at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1F receptors. We conducted this series of experiments to further elucidate the site of action of naratriptan using a well-established animal model of trigeminovascular stimulation. Following electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus of the cat, single cell responses (n=83) were recorded in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Most cells (91%) also responded to electrical and mechanical stimulation of cutaneous or mucosal facial receptive fields. The microiontophoretic application of naratriptan resulted in a significant suppression of the response to sagittal sinus stimulation (response suppressed by 47 +/- 4%, P<0.001). The effect of naratriptan was significantly attenuated by application of either the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR-127935 (P<0.001) or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (P<0.05). The response of single cells to receptive field stimulation was also suppressed by microiontophoretic application of naratriptan, but by only 20 +/- 3%. Intravenous administration of naratriptan resulted in a similar selective suppression of sagittal sinus vs. receptive field responses in trigeminal neurones. These results indicate that naratriptan has a central effect in the trigeminovascular system, selectively inhibiting afferent activity in craniovascular neurones, via both 5-HT(1B/1D) and 5-HT1A receptors.
14729151	Beta-adrenergic receptors couple to CFTR chloride channels of intercalated mitochondria-rich cells in the heterocellular toad skin epithelium.	In the heterocellular toad skin epithelium the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol activates cyclic AMP-dependent Cl(-) channels that are not located in the principal cells. With four experimental approaches, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the signalling pathway targets apical CFTR-chloride channels of mitochondria-rich cells. (i) Serosal application of isoproterenol (log(10)EC50=-7.1+/0.2; Hill coefficient=1.1+/0.2), as well as nor-adrenaline, activated an anion pathway with an apical selectivity sequence, G(Cl)>G(Br)> or =G(NO(3))>G(I), comparable to the published selectivity sequence of cloned human CFTR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. (ii) Known modulators of human CFTR, glibenclamide (200 micromol/l) and genistein (50 micromol/l), depressed and activated, respectively, the receptor-stimulated G(Cl). Genistein did not modify the anion selectivity. (iii) Transcellular voltage clamp studies of single isolated mitochondria-rich cells revealed functional beta-adrenergic receptors on the basolateral membrane. With approximately 60,000 mitochondria-rich cells per cm(2), the saturating activation of 11.9+/-1.6 ns/cell accounted for the measured isoproterenol-activated transepithelial conductance of 600-900 micros/cm(2). In forskolin-stimulated cells, glibenclamide (200 micromol/l) reversibly inhibited the transcellular conductance by 9.6+/1.6 ns/cell. (iv) A nucleotide sequence of one third of the Bufo bufo CFTR gene corresponding to the R-domain and part of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) including its Walker motif was amplified from gallbladder epithelium. Somewhat smaller sequences of the BbCFTR were cloned from lung and isolated skin epithelium. The above new results taken together with our previously identified small-conductance CFTR-like Cl(-) channel in the apical membrane of isolated mitochondria-rich cells provide compelling evidence that the toad's CFTR gene codes for a functional Cl(-) channel in the apical plasma membrane of this minority cell type.
14742690	Aspirin-mediated COX-2 transcript stabilization via sustained p38 activation in human intestinal myofibroblasts.	Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, yet some of its therapeutic effects are thought to derive from mechanisms unrelated to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. In human intestinal myofibroblasts, aspirin, at therapeutic doses, had the unexpected effect of inducing prolonged COX-2 expression. This induction was especially pronounced when cells were treated with interleukin-1alpha (IL-1) plus aspirin for 24 h. Sodium salicylate, a poor COX inhibitor, likewise enhanced IL-1-mediated COX-2 gene expression whereas 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) or indomethacin had no effect. The COX-2 transcriptional rate, measured by nuclear runoff analysis and heterogeneous nuclear RNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was only modestly elevated by aspirin treatment. In contrast, aspirin treatment dramatically stabilized the COX-2 message. The COX-2 mRNA half-life in IL-1 treated cells was 1 h and was increased in excess of 5 h in IL-1 + aspirin-treated cells. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was enhanced in aspirin-treated cells (but not in cells treated with 5-ASA or indomethacin) for up to 24 h after treatment. Inhibition of p38 activity negated aspirin-mediated COX-2 mRNA stabilization and the resultant increase in COX-2 mRNA and protein levels. The modest transcriptional response seen in aspirin treated cells was also abolished by p38 inhibition. We conclude that aspirin enhances COX-2 expression via sustained activation of p38, which results in prolonged stabilization of the COX-2 message and a slightly elevated transcription rate. Aspirin also enhanced steady-state mRNA levels of other IL-1 modulated genes (IL-1beta, IL-6, groalpha, and TNFalpha) that are likewise regulated at the level of message stability via p38 activation.
14744615	5-HT1B receptors and alpha 2A/2C-adrenoceptors mediate external carotid vasoconstriction to dihydroergotamine.	Dihydroergotamine produces external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomized dogs by 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. This study identified the specific subtypes involved in this response. One-minute intracarotid infusions of dihydroergotamine (5.6-10 microg/min) dose-dependently decreased external carotid blood flow without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. This response was: (1) partly blocked in dogs pretreated intravenously with the antagonists SB224289 (5-HT(1B); 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1'-methyl-5-[2'-methyl-4' (5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-carbonyl]furo[2,3-f]indole-3-spiro-4'-piperidine hydrochloride), rauwolscine (alpha(2)), BRL44408 (alpha(2A); 2-[2H-(1-methyl-1,3-dihydroisoindole)methyl]-4,5-dihydroimidazole) or MK912 (alpha(2C); (2S,12bS)-1'3'-dimethylspiro(1,3,4,5',6,6',7,12b-octahydro-2Hbenzo[b]furo[2,3-a]quinazoline)-2,4'-pyrimidin-2'-one); (2) markedly blocked after SB224289 plus rauwolscine; and (3) unaffected after BRL15572 (5-HT(1D); 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-[3,3-diphenyl (2-(S,R) hydroxypropanyl) piperazine] hydrochloride) or imiloxan (alpha(2B)). Therefore, the above response involves 5-HT(1B) receptors and alpha(2A/2C)-adrenoceptors.
1475066	Potential of memantine, D-tubocurarine, and atropine in preventing acute toxic myopathy induced by organophosphate nerve agents: soman, sarin, tabun and VX.	Male Sprague-Dawley rats when administered sc a sublethal dose of organophosphorus cholinesterase inhibitors such as the nerve agents, soman (100 micrograms/kg, sc), sarin (110 micrograms/kg, sc), tabun (200 micrograms/kg, sc), or VX (12 micrograms/kg, sc), developed seizures and severe muscle fasciculations within 15-20 min, lasting for 4-6 hr. Marked inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and necrotic lesions in skeletal muscles such as soleus, extensor digitorum longus, and diaphragm were evident between 1-24 hr following injection. Pretreatment with memantine HCl (MEM, 18 mg/kg, sc) together with atropine sulfate (ATS, 16 mg/kg, sc), 60 min and 15 min, respectively, prior to nerve agents attenuated AChE inhibition, prevented myonecrosis, and muscle fasciculations as well as other signs of cholinergic toxicity. Pretreatment combining d-tubocurarine (d-TC, 0.075 mg/kg, sc) and ATS (16 mg/kg, sc) prevented the myonecrosis and fasciculation without protecting AChE against inhibition by these nerve agents. Neither MEM, d-TC, nor ATS in the concentration given interfered with the normal behavior of the rats. The role of d-TC and ATS interaction with presynaptic receptors regulating ACh release and MEM's role in modulating neural hyperactivity as protective mechanisms are discussed.
14769835	Buspirone raises blood pressure through activation of sympathetic nervous system and by direct activation of alpha1-adrenergic receptors after severe hemorrhage.	5-Hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonists reverse the hypotensive and sympathoinhibitory responses to severe hemorrhage in rats. To determine whether 5-HT1A receptor-mediated pressor responses in hypovolemic animals are due to sympathoexcitation and/or direct vasoconstriction, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) responses to the partial 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone or the more selective, full 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were compared in intact and ganglionic blocked, hemorrhaged Sprague-Dawley rats. Buspirone produced dose-dependent increases in BP (110 +/- 4(**), 86 +/- 4(**), 65 +/- 7 mm Hg), HR [369 +/- 10(**), 337 +/- 14, 277 +/- 16 beats per minute (bpm)], and RSNA (114 +/- 36(**), 34 +/- 21, -23 +/- 25% baseline for 0.2, 0.1, and 0 mg/kg; (**)p < 0.01 versus 0 mg/kg, 3 min after injection). Ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium chloride blocked the pressor effect of 9.9 microg/kg 8-OH-DPAT and attenuated, but did not block, the pressor response to 0.2 mg/kg buspirone (85 +/- 7 versus 46 +/- 6 mm Hg for buspirone + ganglionic blockade versus saline + ganglionic blockade; p < 0.01). In subsequent tests, rats treated with the selective alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin (25 microg/kg) continued to show extensive tachycardic (+73 +/- 26 bpm) and sympathoexcitatory (128 +/- 55% baseline) responses to 0.2 mg/kg buspirone. Ganglionic blockade combined with prazosin completely blocked all responses to buspirone. Buspirone (0.2 mg/kg) produced significant bradycardic (-89 +/- 12 bpm; p < 0.01) and sympathoinhibitory (-72 +/- 7% baseline; p < 0.01) responses in euvolemic rats 3 min after injection. It is concluded that the pressor effect of buspirone is unique to hypovolemic animals and is mediated by sympathetic activation as well as direct activation of vascular alpha1-adrenergic receptors.
1483111	Purification and characterization of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase from porcine aorta.	We purified semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) from porcine aorta by sequential DEAE-Sephacel, DEAE-Sephadex and Affi-gel-Con A chromatography. The analysis of this protein under denaturing conditions exhibited two protein bands migrating at 110-107 kDa. Under non-denaturing conditions only a single protein band was observed. By isoelectric focusing pI of SSAO was estimated to be 5.5. The apparent Km and Vmax of porcine SSAO for oxidation of benzylamine were 4.5 microM and 200 nmol/hr/mg protein, respectively. Porcine SSAO was inhibited both by semicarbazide and phenelzine while deprenyl or clorgyline were without any effect on enzyme activity. IC50 for inhibition of semicarbazide and phenelzine was 0.015 microM and 1 nmol, respectively.
14968366	Alefacept therapy reduces the effector T-cell population in lesional psoriatic epidermis.	Alefacept, a LFA-3/IgG1 fusion protein, interferes with the activation and proliferation of T cells by binding to the CD2 receptor on their surfaces. The clinical efficacy of this drug has been demonstrated in chronic plaque psoriasis. We performed a single-center, open-label study to investigate the immunohistochemical effects in psoriatic lesional skin. A group of 11 patients with plaque psoriasis all received 12 weekly doses of 7.5 mg alefacept intravenously. Skin biopsies were obtained at baseline and on days 8, 43 and 92, and were evaluated by digital image analysis after immunohistochemical staining. After completion of treatment, 8 out of the 11 patients experienced a reduction in PASI of 50% or more compared to baseline. Immunohistochemical analysis displayed a gradual decrease in the number of cutaneous T cells during therapy, with a significant reduction in epidermal CD8+ cells and dermal CD4+ cells on day 92. Patients with a reduction in PASI of 50% or more after therapy had a clearance of effector/memory T cells from the epidermis, in contrast to patients with a reduction in PASI of less than 50%. These findings support the hypothesis that effector/memory T cells play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and that alefacept is capable of reducing these cells in lesional psoriatic skin.
14976318	Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 protein is critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption.	Dietary cholesterol consumption and intestinal cholesterol absorption contribute to plasma cholesterol levels, a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The molecular mechanism of sterol uptake from the lumen of the small intestine is poorly defined. We show that Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1(NPC1L1) protein plays a critical role in the absorption of intestinal cholesterol. NPC1L1 expression is enriched in the small intestine and is in the brush border membrane of enterocytes. Although otherwise phenotypically normal, NPC1L1-deficient mice exhibit a substantial reduction in absorbed cholesterol, which is unaffected by dietary supplementation of bile acids. Ezetimibe, a drug that inhibits cholesterol absorption, had no effect in NPC1L1 knockout mice, suggesting that NPC1L1 resides in an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption.
14993096	Selectivity of (3)H-MADAM binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine transporters in vitro and in vivo in mice; correlation with behavioural effects.	1. Binding of the novel radioligand (3)H-2-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulphanyl)-5-methyl-phenylamine ((3)H-MADAM) to the serotonin transporter (SERT) was used to characterise a range of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in vitro and in vivo. 2. (3)H-MADAM bound with high affinity in a saturable manner to both human SERT expressed in CHO cells (K(d)=0.20 nm (pK(d)=9.74+/-0.12), B(max)=35+/-4 fmol mg(-1) protein) and mouse cerebral cortex membranes (K(d)=0.21 nm (pK(d)=9.66+/-0.10), B(max)=50+/-24 fmol mg(-1) protein). 3. Binding of (3)H-MADAM was highly selective for SERT in vitro as demonstrated by the in vitro profile of MADAM tested at 75 different receptors, ion channels and transporters. This was further substantiated by the pharmacological profile of the binding. Hence, the binding of (3)H-MADAM was potently inhibited by SSRIs but not by selective inhibitors of noradrenaline transport and dopamine transport. Likewise, a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist did not inhibit (3)H-MADAM binding. 4. (3)H-MADAM binding in vivo was inhibited only by compounds which also inhibited the binding of (3)H-MADAM in vitro (the SSRIs, mixed SERT/noradrenaline transport inhibitors and clomipramine), confirming the selectivity of (3)H-MADAM for SERT also in vivo. Moreover, compounds effective in inhibiting (3)H-MADAM binding were the only ones found to be active in the mouse 5-HTP potentiation test confirming the model as a behavioural correlate to in vivo 5-HT uptake. 5. Finally, it was found that a SERT occupancy of 85-95% was necessary to produce 50% of the maximum behavioural response (ED(50)).
15013161	MOR1 receptor mRNA expression in human brains of drug-related fatalities-a real-time PCR quantification.	The expression of the human micro-opiate receptor (MOR1) in post mortem human brain tissue was examined using real-time PCR technology. Tissue samples from 11 fatalities due to opiate overdose and five normal subjects with different causes of death were analysed in order to elucidate whether chronic opiate abuse is followed by a regulation of MOR1 expression. In each case nine selected brain regions (thalamus, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum, hippocampus, amygdala, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, putamen) were evaluated. The MOR1-mRNA level was determined relative to the housekeeping gene beta2-microglobulin. While in most regions the MOR mRNA levels in the brain of addicts were not different from the control group-with varying levels between 0 and 15% of housekeeping gene level-in the brains of three drug-related fatalities an enormous increase was encountered in the thalamus where the MOR-mRNA level amounted for up to 10,000% of the measured housekeeping gene level. The results obtained by toxicological hair analysis in the group of drug-related fatalities indicate that the enormous thalamic MOR1-expression is primarily found in individuals who died from acute heroin overdose but did not show signs of a substantial chronic administration of the drug. Further studies have to be performed to evaluate if the observed MOR1-mRNA up-regulation in the thalamus in a subpopulation of acute lethal intoxications mirrors a state of functional hypersensitivity associated with the occurrence of death.
15026875	Effects of AT1 receptor antagonist losartan on sICAM-1 and TNF-alpha levels in uncomplicated hypertensive patients.	This study was designed to determine whether the levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were elevated in subjects with uncomplicated hypertension who presented with no other risk factors or evidence of athero-sclerosis. The effects of administration of an angiotensin type-1 antagonist (losartan) on the serum concentrations of these molecules were also examined. Twenty hypertensive (HT) subjects (12 men and 8 women, mean age 49.1 +/-7.2 years) without other risk factors or cardiovascular disease received placebo for 4 weeks. The patients were then treated with losartan (50 mg/day) for 24 weeks. After 4, 12, and 24 weeks of losartan treatment, sICAM-1 and TNF-alpha levels were measured. The same parameters were measured in 20 normotensive control subjects (C), matched for sex and age. HT had sICAM-1 and TNF-alpha basal values higher than C (respectively 351.7 +/-97.4 vs 201.6 +/-32.3 ng/mL, p<0.001 and 31.8 +/-2.4 vs 15.3 +/-2.2 pg/mL, p<0.001). There was a positive correlation between sICAM-1 and TNF-alpha levels, but no correlation in HT between the average diastolic and systolic blood pressure (clinic and ambulatory monitoring) and the sICAM-1 or TNF-alpha levels was observed. Losartan treatment caused a significant decrease of sICAM-1 levels at the end of the first month of treatment (300.2 +/-64.4 ng/mL, p<0.05), but the values reverted to the basal levels at the following time points. No variation of TNF-alpha levels during losartan treatment was observed. These results show that patients with uncomplicated mild essential hypertension presented with high plasma ICAM-1 and TNF-alpha concentrations. Although all the patients were responsive to the antihypertensive treatment with losartan, their plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha were not modified, and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased only for a short period of time. This suggests that in uncomplicated hypertension other factors besides the blood pressure modulate the endothelial inflammation.
15037111	Pharmacological characteristics of AFP-168 (tafluprost), a new prostanoid FP receptor agonist, as an ocular hypotensive drug.	To evaluate the pharmacological characteristics of AFP-168 (tafluprost), a new prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) derivative, we examined its receptor-binding affinities, intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect, effects on aqueous humor dynamics, and stimulating effect on melanogenesis. The receptor-binding profile for AFP-172, a carboxylic acid of AFP-168, was determined by measuring muscle contractions in an organ bath, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and competitive binding of a radio-labelled ligand. For the IOP-measurement study, ocular normotensive and laser-induced ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys were used, and IOP was measured using a pneumatonograph. For the studies of aqueous humor dynamics, IOP (Goldmann applanation tonometry), fluorophotometry, two-level constant pressure perfusion, and isotope dilution and accumulation techniques were used in ocular normotensive monkeys. The melanin contents in the medium and in the cell bodies of cultured B16-F0 melanoma cells were measured. The affinity for the FP receptor shown by AFP-172 (Ki : 0.4 nm) was 12 times that of PhXA85 ( Ki : 4.7 nm), a carboxylic acid of latanoprost. A single application of AFP-168 at 0.0025% significantly lowered IOP in both ocular normotensive and hypertensive monkeys (3.1 and 11.8 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.01) and latanoprost at 0.005% significantly lowered IOP (2.1 mmHg, p < 0.01 and 9.5 mmHg, p = 0.059 respectively). Once daily instillation of AFP-168 at 0.001, 0.0025, or 0.005% for 5 days in normotensive monkeys significantly reduced IOP not only for a few hours, but also at the drug-trough time 24hr after application. Latanoprost at 0.005% also reduced IOP, but not at the drug-trough time. AFP-168 decreased IOP mainly by increasing uveoscleral outflow by 65% (p < 0.05) and, as sometimes seen with other prostanoids, also increased total outflow facility (33% increase, p < 0.05). In cultured B16-F0 melanoma cells, AFP-172 (100 microM) did not stimulate melanogenesis, but PhXA85 (100 microM) did. These findings indicate that AFP-168 has a high affinity for the prostanoid FP receptor, has potent IOP-lowering effects in both ocular normotensive and hypertensive monkeys that exceed those of latanoprost, and has less stimulating effect on melanogenesis in melanoma cells.
15039140	Oxysterols trigger ABCA1-mediated basolateral surfactant efflux.	Surfactant is an apically-secreted surface-active material containing primarily disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPtdCho) that is released from alveolar epithelia into the alveolus. Surfactant deficiency is an important aspect of inflammatory lung disease and may result from extravasation of serum lipoproteins into the alveolus. We investigated whether one bioactive component of modified lipoproteins, oxysterols, might reduce surfactant PtdCho availability by altering its trafficking. The oxysterol, 22-hydroxycholesterol (22HC), in combination with its obligate partner, 9 cis-retinoic acid (RA), decreased surfactant PtdCho levels, in part, by stimulating basolateral phospholipid export in murine lung epithelia. 22HC/RA stimulated basolateral PtdCho efflux in cells via transcriptional activation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) gene. This effect was mediated by a DR-4 locus within the ABCA1 promoter. ABCA1 knockdown studies using ABCA1 siRNA or the ABCA1 inhibitor, glyburide, selectively attenuated 22HC/RA-driven basolateral PtdCho efflux. 22HC/RA significantly increased export of PtdCho molecular species containing saturated (16:0) fatty-acyl species typical of DSPtdCho. Overexpression of ABCA1 mimicked 22HC/RA effects by increasing cellular PtdCho efflux, whereas mutagenesis of ABCA1 at Trp590 attenuated PtdCho release. The results indicate the existence of an oxysterol-activated basolateral exit pathway for surfactant that might impact the availability of phospholipid destined for apical secretion.
15044619	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and multidrug resistance protein 1 act in synergy to protect melanoma cells from vincristine effects.	Previous studies have shown that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can operate in synergy with efflux transporters, multi-drug resistance proteins (MRPs), to confer resistance to several carcinogens, mutagens and anticancer drugs. To address the poorly documented role of the GSTM1 in cancer chemoresistance, we used CAL1 human melanoma cells expressing no endogenous GSTM1 and a high level of MRP1. Cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the GSTM1 cDNA, and different clones were selected expressing different levels of GSTM1 (RT-PCR, Western blot, and enzyme activity). Cells overexpressing GSTM1 displayed a 3- to 4-fold increase in resistance to anticancer drugs vincristine (VCR) and chlorambucil (CHB) in proliferation, cytotoxic, and clonogenic survival assays. Inhibitors of MRP1 (sulfinpyrazone, verapamil) and GST (dicumarol, curcumin) completely reversed the GSTM1-associated resistance to VCR, indicating that a MRP efflux function is necessary to potentiate GSTM1-mediated resistance to VCR. Conversely, MRP1 inhibitors had no effect on the sensitivity to CHB. Using immunofluorescence assay, GSTM1 was also shown to protect microtubule network integrity from VCR-induced inhibition of microtubule polymerization. In conclusion, these results show that GSTM1 alone is involved in melanoma resistance to CHB, whereas it can act in synergy with MRP1 to protect cells from toxic effects of VCR.
15046718	Noxious cold ion channel TRPA1 is activated by pungent compounds and bradykinin.	Six members of the mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels respond to varied temperature thresholds. The natural compounds capsaicin and menthol activate noxious heat-sensitive TRPV1 and cold-sensitive TRPM8, respectively. The burning and cooling perception of capsaicin and menthol demonstrate that these ion channels mediate thermosensation. We show that, in addition to noxious cold, pungent natural compounds present in cinnamon oil, wintergreen oil, clove oil, mustard oil, and ginger all activate TRPA1 (ANKTM1). Bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide acting through its G protein-coupled receptor, also activates TRPA1. We further show that phospholipase C is an important signaling component for TRPA1 activation. Cinnamaldehyde, the most specific TRPA1 activator, excites a subset of sensory neurons highly enriched in cold-sensitive neurons and elicits nociceptive behavior in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRPA1 activation elicits a painful sensation and provide a potential molecular model for why noxious cold can paradoxically be perceived as burning pain.
15056115	Involvement of matrix metalloproteinases in the onset of dentin mineralization.	In order to study the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on dentin formation and mineralization, day 18 embryonic mouse tooth germs were cultured for 10 d in the presence or absence of Marimastat, a general MMP inhibitor, or CT(1166), a more selective inhibitor of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). With Marimastat a dose-dependent increase in thickness of the predentin layer and a decreased mineralization of dentin were observed. At the highest concentration of the inhibitor used, enamel formation had ceased. With CT(1166), these effects were already apparent at the lowest concentration used. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the two inhibitors inhibited the expression of enamelysin (MMP-20). These observations indicate that MMPs (possibly MMP-2, -3, -9 and/or -20) play a role in the onset of dentin mineralization. The lack of enamel formation was possibly due to diffusion of amelogenin from its normal site of apposition. The protein clearly was not retained at the surface of the non-mineralized dentin layer, and immunopositive amelogenin accumulated in the odontoblast compartment. The diffusion of enamel proteins and the accumulation revealed by immunolabeling of two small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, in the predentin may have contributed to impaired dentin mineralization.
15056483	Biochemical and pharmacological characterization of the serotonin transporter in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.	The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) plays a critical role in the termination of serotonin neurotransmission and represents the prime target for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In the present study, the 5-HTT protein in human peripheral blood lymphocyte was characterized pharmacologically and biochemically. The tricyclic antidepressant drug [(3)H]imipramine, an established ligand for the neuronal and platelet 5-HTT, bound saturably and reversibly to a single population of non-interacting binding sites in fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The affinity of [(3)H]imipramine (K(d)) to the transporter, calculated from association and dissociation kinetic experiments, was similar to that obtained from the equilibrium study. The function of the transporter was studied using high affinity [(3)H]5-HT uptake into fresh lymphocytes. [(3)H]Imipramine binding and [(3)H]5-HT uptake were inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants as well as by SSRIs. Western blot analysis as well as immunoprecipitation analysis revealed labeling of a single protein band of approximately 100 kDa. The presence of the 5-HTT in easily accessible nucleated cells such as peripheral blood lymphocytes might permit molecular genetic studies in mood and anxiety disorder patients, and might enhance the understanding of the different efficacies of antidepressants in depressed patients.
15059893	Hypermethylation and silencing of the putative tumor suppressor Tazarotene-induced gene 1 in human cancers.	A variety of tumor suppressor genes are down-regulated by hypermethylation during carcinogenesis. Using methylated CpG amplification-representation difference analysis, we identified a DNA fragment corresponding to the Tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) promoter-associated CpG island as one of the genes hypermethylated in the leukemia cell line K562. Because TIG1 has been proposed to act as a tumor suppressor, we tested the hypothesis that cytosine methylation of the TIG1 promoter suppresses its expression and causes a loss of responsiveness to retinoic acid in some neoplastic cells. We examined TIG1 methylation and expression status in 53 human cancer cell lines and 74 primary tumors, including leukemia and head and neck, breast, colon, skin, brain, lung, and prostate cancer. Loss of TIG1 expression was strongly associated with TIG1 promoter hypermethylation (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between TIG1 promoter methylation and that of retinoid acid receptor beta2 (RARbeta2), another retinoic-induced putative tumor suppressor gene (P = 0.78). Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine for 5 days restored TIG1 expression in all eight silenced cell lines tested. TIG1 expression was also inducible by treatment with 1 micro M all-trans-retinoic acid for 3 days except in densely methylated cell lines. Treatment of the K562 leukemia cells with demethylating agent combined with all-trans-retinoic acid induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that silencing of TIG1 promoter by hypermethylation is common in human cancers and may contribute to the loss of retinoic acid responsiveness in some neoplastic cells.
15094841	Glutathione S-transferase pi as a target for tricyclic antidepressants in human brain.	GST pi, the main glutathione S-transferase isoform present in the human brain, was isolated from various regions of the brain and the in vitro effect of tricyclic antidepressants on its activity was studied. The results indicated that amitripyline and doxepin--derivatives of dibenzcycloheptadiene, as well as imipramine and clomipramine--derivatives of dibenzazepine, inhibit the activity of GST pi from frontal and parietal cortex, hippocampus and brain stem. All these tricyclics are noncompetitive inhibitors of the enzyme with respect to reduced glutathione and noncompetitive (amitripyline, doxepin) or uncompetitive (imipramine, clomipramine) with respect to the electrophilic substrate. Their inhibitory effect is reversible and it depends on the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressants rather than on the brain localization of the enzyme. We conclude that the interaction between GST pi and the drugs may reduce their availability in the brain and thus affect their therapeutic activity. On the other hand, tricyclic antidepressants may decrease the efficiency of the enzymatic barrier formed by GST and increase the exposure of brain to toxic electrophiles. Reactive electrophiles not inactivated by GST may contribute in adverse effects caused by these drugs.
15098086	Inhibition of human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels by alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin.	Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channels are expressed in multiple tissues including the heart and adenocarcinomas. In cardiomyocytes, HERG encodes the alpha-subunit underlying the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, I(Kr), and pharmacological reduction of HERG currents may cause acquired long QT syndrome. In addition, HERG currents have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Recently, doxazosin has been associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Moreover, quinazoline-derived alpha 1-inhibitors induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and prostate tumor cells independently of alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade. To assess the action of the effects of prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin on HERG currents, we investigated their acute electrophysiological effects on cloned HERG potassium channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells.Prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin blocked HERG currents in Xenopus oocytes with IC(50) values of 10.1, 18.2, and 113.2 microM respectively, whereas the IC(50) values for HERG channel inhibition in human HEK 293 cells were 1.57 microM, 585.1 nM, and 17.7 microM. Detailed biophysical studies revealed that inhibition by the prototype alpha 1-blocker prazosin occurred in closed, open, and inactivated channels. Analysis of the voltage-dependence of block displayed a reduction of inhibition at positive membrane potentials. Frequency-dependence was not observed. Prazosin caused a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of both activation (-3.8 mV) and inactivation (-9.4 mV). The S6 mutations Y652A and F656A partially attenuated (Y652A) or abolished (F656A) HERG current blockade, indicating that prazosin binds to a common drug receptor within the pore-S6 region. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HERG potassium channels are blocked by prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin. These data may provide a hypothetical molecular explanation for the apoptotic effect of quinazoline-derived alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists.
15100703	Buprenorphine antinociception is abolished, but naloxone-sensitive reward is retained, in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice.	Buprenorphine is a relatively nonselective opioid receptor partial agonist that is used in the management of both pain and addiction. To improve understanding of the opioid receptor subtypes important for buprenorphine effects, we now report the results of our investigation on the roles of mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors in antinociceptive responses and place preferences induced by buprenorphine. Buprenorphine antinociception, assessed by hot-plate and tail-flick tests, was significantly reduced in heterozygous mu-opioid receptor knockout (MOR-KO) mice and abolished in homozygous MOR-KO mice. In contrast, buprenorphine retained its ability to establish a conditioned place preference (CPP) in homozygous MOR-KO, although the magnitude of place preference was reduced as the number of copies of wild-type mu-opioid receptor genes was reduced. The remaining CPP of buprenorphine was abolished by pretreatment with the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone, but only partially blocked by pretreatment with either the delta-selective opioid antagonist naltrindole or the kappa-selective opioid antagonist norbinaltorphimine. These data, and biochemical confirmation of buprenorphine actions as a partial delta-, mu-, and kappa-agonist, support the ideas that mu-opioid receptors mediate most of analgesic properties of buprenorphine, but that mu- and delta- and/or kappa-opioid receptors are each involved in the rewarding effects of this drug.
15105445	Regulation of cardiac contractility by Rab4-modulated beta2-adrenergic receptor recycling.	Catecholaminergic activation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors (betaAR) is the principle mechanism regulating cardiac function. Agonists desensitize betaAR through G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated uncoupling and beta-arrestin-mediated internalization. Although inhibition of myocardial G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 enhances cardiac function and reverses heart failure, pathophysiological effects of modulated betaAR internalization/recycling are unknown. We used mutation and transgenic expression of Rab4, which regulates vesicular transport of heptahelical receptors to plasma membranes, to interrogate in vivo betaAR trafficking and cardiac function. Expression of constitutively active Rab4 Q72L had no effects on cardiac structure or function, but dominant inhibitor Rab4 S27N impaired responsiveness to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. To relate betaAR trafficking to diminished cardiac function, Rab4 mutant mice were crossbred with mice overexpressing human beta2AR. In unstimulated beta2AR overexpressors, beta2AR localized to heavier endosomes and translocated to lighter, caveolin-rich fractions after isoproterenol stimulation. Coexpression of beta2AR with activated Rab4 Q72L caused loss of receptors from heavier endosomes while retaining normal inotropy. In contrast, coexpression of beta2AR with inhibitory Rab4 S27N mimicked isoproterenol-induced receptor redistribution to caveolae, with diminished cardiac inotropy. Rab4 inhibition alone prevented resensitization after isoproterenol-induced in vivo adrenergic desensitization. Confocal and ultrastructural analyses revealed bizarre vesicular structures and abnormal accumulation of beta2AR in the sarcoplasm and subsarcollema of Rab4 S27N, but not Q72L, mice. These data provide evidence for constant bidirectional sarcollemal-vesicular betaAR trafficking in the in vivo heart and show that Rab4-mediated recycling of internalized betaAR is necessary for normal cardiac catecholamine responsiveness and resensitization after agonist exposure.
15108178	Association of a long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 gene polymorphism with depression and with enhanced niacin-induced dermal erythema.	Hypotheses about relationships between changes in membrane lipids and mental illness have focused primarily on three long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Membrane deficiencies of these fatty acids have been reported in schizophrenia (AA, EPA, and DHA) and in depression (EPA and DHA). Long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase type 4 (FACL4; MIM 300157) is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of AA, EPA, and DHA. FACL4 selectively esterifies these fatty acids with co-enzyme A, forming acyl-co-A, which can then be incorporated into membrane phospholipid. We used niacin-induced dermal erythema as one index of AA metabolism to identify a common C to T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the first intron of the FACL4 gene (Xq22.3), which is associated with enhanced dermal erythema in both schizophrenia and control subjects. Male subjects with the T0 genotype showed greater dermal erythema following topical application of methylnicotinate, suggesting that this polymorphism may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional polymorphism of the FACL4 gene that modulates re-sequestration of agonist-released free AA. We also examined the allele frequency of this polymorphism in 555 European-Americans (EA), including 229 control subjects, 198 subjects with major depression, 58 with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 70 with alcohol dependence without co-morbid psychiatric illness. We observed a significant excess of the T allele in subjects with major depression, as compared with controls (49% vs. 38%; P = 0.003) and a non-significant excess of the T allele in schizophrenia (44%; P = 0.29). The allele frequency for subjects with alcohol dependence did not differ from controls.
15111016	Topiramate selectively protects against seizures induced by ATPA, a GluR5 kainate receptor agonist.	Although the mechanism of action of topiramate is not fully understood, its anticonvulsant properties may result, at least in part, from an interaction with AMPA/kainate receptors. We have recently shown that topiramate selectively inhibits postsynaptic responses mediated by GluR5 kainate receptors. To determine if this action of topiramate is relevant to the anticonvulsant effects of the drug in vivo, we determined the protective activity of topiramate against seizures induced by intravenous infusion of various ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists in mice. Topiramate (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent elevation in the threshold for clonic seizures induced by infusion of ATPA, a selective agonist of GluR5 kainate receptors. Topiramate was less effective in protecting against clonic seizures induced by kainate, a mixed agonist of AMPA and kainate receptors. Topiramate did not affect clonic seizures induced by AMPA or NMDA. In contrast, the thresholds for tonic seizures induced by higher doses of these various glutamate receptor agonists were all elevated by topiramate. Unlike topiramate, carbamazepine elevated the threshold for AMPA- but not ATPA-induced clonic seizures. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the effects of topiramate on clonic seizure activity are due to functional blockade of GluR5 kainate receptors. Protection from tonic seizures may be mediated by other actions of the drug. Together with our in vitro cellular electrophysiological results, the present observations strongly support a unique mechanism of action of topiramate, which involves GluR5 kainate receptors.
15113605	Perinatal cocaine exposure reduces myocardial norepinephrine transporter function in the neonatal rat.	Norepinephrine transporter (NET) mediates the active removal of norepinephrine (NE) released from sympathetic nerve terminals via reuptake, and NET function and expression can be regulated by cocaine. NET expression and its regulation by cocaine in the developing sympathetic nervous system during early postnatal period, however, have not been examined. We quantified immunodetectable NET protein expression in the neonatal rat heart to examine the developmental pattern of myocardial NET during the first 2 weeks after birth. To assess sympathetic innervations, we simultaneously quantified the expression of myocardial tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Timed pregnant rats received daily intragastric treatment with saline (CTL) or cocaine at 60 mg/kg (Coc) from Gestational Day 2 until parturition. After birth, nursing mothers continued to receive the same treatment. The expression of myocardial TH and NET in neonatal rats were then studied at 1 day (Postnatal Day 1, PD1), 7 days (PD7) or 14 days (PD14) of age. We observed a similar age-dependent increase in the expression for myocardial NET and TH during the first 2 weeks of postnatal life, in both CTL and Coc animals. While myocardial TH was significantly up-regulated following perinatal cocaine exposure, no significant change in immunodetectable myocardial NET protein was evident. To further examine whether NET function might be affected by perinatal cocaine exposure, we performed NE uptake in myocardial membranes from PD14 CTL and Coc rats. We found that NE uptake was reduced at PD14 in the cocaine-treated group. Our results indicate that myocardial NET and TH are both developmentally regulated. Furthermore, our results indicate that perinatal exposure to cocaine did not change NET protein expression but impaired myocardial NET function in the neonatal rat.
15115391	Synthesis of 2,4-diamino-6-[2'-O-(omega-carboxyalkyl)oxydibenz[b,f]azepin-5-yl]methylpteridines as potent and selective inhibitors of Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium avium dihydrofolate reductase.	Six previously undescribed N-(2,4-diaminopteridin-6-yl)methyldibenz[b,f]azepines with water-solubilizing O-carboxyalkyloxy or O-carboxybenzyloxy side chains at the 2'-position were synthesized and compared with trimethoprim (TMP) and piritrexim (PTX) as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), Toxoplasma gondii (Tg), and Mycobacterium avium (Ma), three of the opportunistic organisms known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS and other disorders of the immune system. The ability of the new analogues to inhibit reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by Pc, Tg, Ma, and rat DHFR was determined, and the selectivity index (SI) was calculated from the ratio IC(50)(rat DHFR)/IC(50)(Pc, Tg, or Ma DHFR). The IC(50) values of the 2'-O-carboxypropyl analogue (10), with SI values in parentheses, were 1.1 nM (1300) against Pc DHFR, 9.9 nM (120) against Tg DHFR, and 2.0 nM (600) against Ma DHFR. The corresponding values for the 2'-O-(4-carboxybenzyloxy) analogue (12) were 1.0 nM (560), 22 nM (21), and 0.75 nM (630). By comparison, the IC(50) and SI values for TMP were Pc, 13 000 nM (14); Tg, 2800 nM (65); and Ma, 300 nM (610). For the prototypical potent but nonselective inhibitors PTX and TMX, respectively, these values were Pc, 13 nM (0.26) and 47 nM (0.17); Tg, 4.3 nM (0.76) and 16 nM (0.50); Ma, 0.61 nM (5.4) and 1.5 nM (5.3). Thus 10 and 12 met the criterion for DHFR inhibitors that combine the high selectivity of TMP with the high potency of PTX and TMX.
15125690	Acidification alters antiarrhythmic drug blockade of the ether-a-go-go-related Gene (HERG) Channels.	Acidosis is one of the important deleterious factors during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion. The ether-a-go-go-related gene, HERG, is a primary target for blockade by many drugs including dofetilide, quinidine and azimilide. While most drugs lose their efficacy against arrhythmias associated with myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion, dofetilide remains effective. The unique ability of dofetilide to terminate ischaemia-induced arrhythmias is not yet fully explained. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the acidification modulation of antiarrhythmic drugs blockade of HERG channels. The human gene HERG encoding K+ channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and Whole-cell macroscopic currents of Xenopus oocytes were recorded with conventional two-electrode techniques. The inhibitory effects of dofetilide (0.25 microM) were significantly enhanced with decreasing pH (from 7.5 to 6.5). The percent block of dofetilide under pH 6.5 at 0 mV was 69+/-6.1% versus 54+/-3.0% under pH 7.5 (n=7, P<0.05). The IC50 values, determined by the Hill equation with the currents recorded at 0 mV, were decreased by approximately half from 192+/-23 nM with pH 7.5 to 93+/-15 nM with pH 6.5 (P<0.01). Acidification weakened the inhibitory effects of quinidine and azimilide on HERG channels. At 0 mV, the percent block of quinidine (10 microM) under pH 6.5 was 24+/-2.8% versus 62.5+/-9.0% under pH 7.5 (n=4, P<0.01), The percent block of azimilide (10 microM) under pH 6.5 was similar to that under pH 7.5 (n=6). Acidification markedly potentiated dofetilide blockade of the HERG channels but weakened the inhibitory effects of quinidine and azimilide.
15135665	Lidoflazine is a high affinity blocker of the HERG K(+)channel.	Lidoflazine is an antianginal calcium channel blocker that carries a significant risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. We investigated whether or not lidoflazine inhibits current through the rapid delayed rectifier K(+) channel alpha subunit (encoded by HERG - human ether-a-go-go-related gene), since this channel has been widely linked to drug-induced QT-prolongation. Lidoflazine inhibited potently HERG current (I(HERG)) recorded from HEK 293 cells stably expressing wild-type HERG (IC(50) of approximately 16 nM). It was approximately 13-fold more potent against HERG than was verapamil under similar conditions. On membrane depolarization, I(HERG) inhibition developed gradually, ruling out closed-channel state dependent inhibition. The effect of command voltage on the drug's action suggested that lidoflazine preferentially inhibits activated/open HERG channels. The S6 mutation Y652A largely eliminated the inhibitory action of lidoflazine, whilst the F656A mutation also reduced blocking potency. We conclude: first, that lidoflazine produces high affinity blockade of the alpha subunit of the HERG channel by binding to aromatic amino acid residues within the channel pore and, second, that this is likely to represent the molecular mechanism of QT interval prolongation by this drug.
15138278	A fatty acid synthase blockade induces tumor cell-cycle arrest by down-regulating Skp2.	In eukaryotes, fatty acid synthase (FAS) is the enzyme responsible for synthesis of palmitate, the precursor of long-chain nonessential fatty acids. FAS is up-regulated in a wide range of cancers and has been suggested as a relevant drug target. Here, two independent approaches are taken toward knocking down FAS and then probing its connection to tumor cell proliferation. In one approach, Orlistat, a drug approved for treating obesity, is used as a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase function of FAS. In a separate strategy, the expression of FAS is suppressed by targeted knock-down with small interfering RNA. In both circumstances, the ablation of FAS activity causes a dramatic down-regulation of Skp2, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls the turnover of p27Kip1. These effects ultimately tie into the retinoblastoma protein pathway and lead to a cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary. Altogether, the findings of the study reveal unappreciated links between fatty acid synthase and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of cell-cycle regulatory proteins.
15140279	Effects of dopamine D2 receptor Ser311Cys polymorphism and clinical factors on risperidone efficacy for positive and negative symptoms and social function.	Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent with efficacy for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, what makes an antipsychotic 'atypical' remains unclear. We recently found that the T102C polymorphism in the 5-HT2A receptor gene could affect risperidone's efficacy for negative symptoms. The present study investigated the effect of the Ser311Cys polymorphism in the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene on risperidone treatment response. A total of 123 Han Chinese patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia were given risperidone for up to 42 days. Clinical manifestations were measured bi-weekly with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatients Evaluation (NOSIE, for assessment of social function). For adjusting the within-subject dependence over repeated assessments, multiple linear regression with generalized estimating equation methods was utilized to analyse the effects of Ser311Cys polymorphism and other covariates on clinical performance. Compared with patients who had the Ser311Ser genotype, patients with the Ser311Cys genotype had lower scores on PANSS Positive, Negative, General Psychopathology and Cognitive subscales and NOSIE, after adjustment for 5-HT2A T102C polymorphisms and other confounders. The 5-HT2A T102C polymorphism had marginal influences on PANSS Total and Negative subscale scores. Male gender, fewer previous hospitalizations, and higher risperidone dose predicted better treatment response after control for other variables. The preliminary results suggest that variations in the DRD2 gene influence risperidone treatment response for positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, general psychopathology, and social functioning. Several clinical factors may also contribute to inter-individual differences in risperidone treatment response.
15148258	Inhibition of cardiac HERG currents by the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor amsacrine: mode of action.	1 The topoisomerase II inhibitor amsacrine is used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. Although most anticancer drugs are believed not to cause acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS), concerns have been raised by reports of QT interval prolongation, ventricular fibrillation and death associated with amsacrine treatment. Since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium currents is an important cause of acquired LQTS, we investigated the acute effects of amsacrine on cloned HERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its proarrhythmic potential. 2 HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human HEK 293 cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the respective potassium currents were recorded using patch-clamp and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. 3 Amsacrine blocked HERG currents in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 209.4 nm and 2.0 microm, respectively. 4 HERG channels were primarily blocked in the open and inactivated states, and no additional voltage dependence was observed. Amsacrine caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of both activation (-7.6 mV) and inactivation (-7.6 mV). HERG current block by amsacrine was not frequency dependent. 5 The S6 domain mutations Y652A and F656A attenuated (Y652A) or abolished (F656A, Y652A/F656A) HERG current blockade, indicating that amsacrine binding requires a common drug receptor within the pore-S6 region. 6 In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the anticancer drug amsacrine is an antagonist of cloned HERG potassium channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the previously reported QTc interval prolongation during clinical administration of amsacrine.
15155210	Application of real-time quantitative PCR to molecular analysis of Candida albicans strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to azoles.	Real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps, ERG11 and two control genes, ACT1 and PMA1, in a collection of 14 fluconazole-susceptible Candida albicans isolates. For each gene, average expression levels and variations within the population were determined. These values were then used as reference points to make predictions about the molecular basis of resistance in 38 clinical isolates (the majority of which were resistant to fluconazole) obtained from 18 patients treated with posaconazole for refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis. For each of the 38 isolates, the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps, ERG11 and the control genes, were measured as above. Comparison of the two data sets revealed that expression of ACT1 and PMA1 did not vary significantly between the two sets of isolates. In contrast, MDR1, ERG11, CDR1, and CDR2 were overexpressed in 3, 4, 14, and 35, respectively, of the isolates from patients treated with azoles. In addition to these changes, the patient isolates all had at least one and often multiple missense mutations in ERG11. Select ERG11 alleles were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; all of the alleles tested conferred reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. Despite both the increases in pump expression and the ERG11 mutations, only one of the patient isolates exhibited a large decrease in posaconazole susceptibility.
15157745	Effect of repeat exposure on neuroendocrine and symptom responses to pentagastrin.	The cholecystokinin (CCK-B) agonist pentagastrin stimulates dose-dependent release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol in humans, likely via direct pharmacological action at pituitary CCK-B receptors. Pentagastrin also produces side effects, however, which may be experienced as novel or anxiety arousing and could contribute to ACTH release. Available data suggest that pentagastrin's activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is unrelated to anxiety symptoms themselves, but novelty effects have not been examined in this model and do strongly activate this system in animals. To further explore the impact of novelty and anxiety symptoms on HPA responses, pentagastrin was administered twice to 12 subjects (six male, six female) under single-blind conditions. Repeat pentagastrin injection was associated with a slight habituation in the magnitude of symptom and HPA axis responses, but robust HPA and symptom responses were seen following both injections. No relationships were found between anxiety symptoms and HPA activity and the modest symptomatic and neuroendocrine habituation appeared to occur independently. Pentagastrin may release ACTH and cortisol through direct pharmacological action, perhaps enhanced on first exposure by psychologically mediated novelty effects. Novelty, per se, is not likely the primary mediator of the HPA response. This model may be useful for further study of cognitive-emotional modulators of HPA axis activity.
15161930	Structural basis for the deactivation of the estrogen-related receptor gamma by diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen and determinants of selectivity.	The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gamma behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. Although no natural ligand is known, ERRgamma is deactivated by the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist diethylstilbestrol and the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen but does not significantly respond to estradiol or raloxifene. Here we report the crystal structures of the ERRgamma ligand binding domain (LBD) complexed with diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Antagonist binding to ERRgamma results in a rotation of the side chain of Phe-435 that partially fills the cavity of the apoLBD. The new rotamer of Phe-435 displaces the "activation helix" (helix 12) from the agonist position observed in the absence of ligand. In contrast to the complexes of the ERalpha LBD with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or raloxifene, helix 12 of antagonist-bound ERRgamma does not occupy the coactivator groove but appears to be completely dissociated from the LBD body. Comparison of the ligand-bound LBDs of ERRgamma and ERalpha reveals small but significant differences in the architecture of the ligand binding pockets that result in a slightly shifted binding position of diethylstilbestrol and a small rotation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the cavity of ERRgamma relative to ERalpha. Our results provide detailed molecular insight into the conformational changes occurring upon binding of synthetic antagonists to the constitutive orphan receptor ERRgamma and reveal structural differences with ERs that explain why ERRgamma does not bind estradiol or raloxifene and will help to design new selective antagonists.
15175324	The sensitivity of G protein-activated K+ channels toward halothane is essentially determined by the C terminus.	G protein-activated K(+) channels (GIRKs or Kir3.x) are targets for the volatile anesthetic, halothane. When coexpressed with the m(2) acetylcholine (ACh) receptor in Xenopus oocytes, agonist-activated GIRK1(F137S)- and GIRK2-mediated currents are inhibited by halothane, whereas in the absence of ACh, high concentrations of halothane induce GIRK1(F137S)-mediated currents. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of halothane action on GIRK currents of different subunit compositions, we constructed deletion mutants of GIRK1(F137S) (GIRK1(Delta363*)) and GIRK2 (GIRK2(Delta356)) lacking the C-terminal ends, as well as chimeric GIRK channels. Mutated GIRK channels showed normal currents when activated by ACh but exhibited different pharmacological properties toward halothane. GIRK2(Delta356) showed no sensitivity against the inhibitory action of halothane but was activated by halothane in the absence of an agonist. GIRK1(Delta363*) was activated by halothane more efficiently. Currents mediated by chimeric channels were inhibited by anesthetic concentrations that were at least 30-fold lower than those necessary to decrease GIRK2 wild type currents. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments did not show displacement of bound Gbetagamma by halothane, indicating that halothane does not interfere with Gbetagamma binding. Single channel experiments revealed an influence of halothane on the gating of the channels: The agonist-induced currents of GIRK1 and GIRK2, carried mainly by brief openings, were inhibited, whereas higher concentrations of the anesthetic promoted long openings of GIRK1 channels. Because the C terminus is crucial for these effects, an interaction of halothane with the channel seems to be involved in the mechanism of current modulation.
15178355	Pharmacological characterization of dihydromorphine, 6-acetyldihydromorphine and dihydroheroin analgesia and their differentiation from morphine.	The present study examined the pharmacology of dihydromorphine, 6-acetyldihydromorphine and dihydroheroin (3,6-diacetyldihydromorphine). Like morphine, dihydromorphine and its acetylated derivatives all were highly selective mu-opioids in receptor binding assays. All the compounds were potent mu-selective analgesics, as shown by their sensitivity towards the mu-selective opioid receptor antagonists naloxonazine and beta-funaltrexamine. However, the actions of dihydromorphine and its analogs were readily distinguished from those of morphine, differences that were surprising in view of the very limited structural differences among them that consisted of only the reduction of the 7,8-double bond. Like heroin and morphine-6beta-glucuronide, the analgesic actions of dihydromorphine and its two acetylated derivatives were antagonized by 3-O-methylnaltrexone at a dose that was inactive against morphine analgesia. Antisense mapping also distinguished between morphine and the dihydromorphine compounds. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting exon 2 of the cloned MOR-1 gene decreased dihydromorphine analgesia and that of its acetylated derivatives, but not morphine analgesia. Conversely, the exon 1 antisense that effectively lowered morphine analgesia was inactive against dihydromorphine and its analogs. Finally, dihydromorphine and its analogs retained their analgesic activity in a mouse model of morphine tolerance, consistent with incomplete cross-tolerance. Together, these findings imply that the mu-opioid receptor mechanisms mediating the analgesic actions of dihydromorphine and its acetylated analogs are distinct from morphine and more similar to those of heroin and morphine-6beta-glucuronide.
15189034	Progesterone receptor ligand binding pocket flexibility: crystal structures of the norethindrone and mometasone furoate complexes.	Although progesterone, the natural ligand of the progesterone receptor (PR), has a hydrogen atom at the 17alpha position, other potent steroid agonists such as norethindrone and mometasone furoate have larger substituents at this position that are accommodated by the PR ligand binding pocket. Crystallographic analysis of PR ligand binding domain complexes clearly demonstrated that these moieties were accommodated by local shifts of the protein main chain and by adoption of alternative side chain rotamer conformations of ligand-proximal amino acids. These conformational changes imparted a ligand-specific volume to the binding pocket, from 490 A3 in the metribolone complex to 520 A3 in the norethindrone complex, 565 A3 in the progesterone complex, and 730 A3 in the mometasone furoate complex. Despite these marked alterations in binding pocket volume, critical interactions essential for establishment of an active AF2 conformation were maintained.
15190109	TRPM8 activation by menthol, icilin, and cold is differentially modulated by intracellular pH.	TRPM8 is a nonselective cation channel activated by cold and the cooling compounds menthol and icilin (Peier et al., 2002). Here, we have used electrophysiology and the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2 to study the effect of pH and interactions between temperature, pH, and the two chemical agonists menthol and icilin on TRPM8 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Menthol, icilin, and cold all evoked stimulus-dependent [Ca2+]i responses in standard physiological solutions of pH 7.3. Increasing the extracellular [H+] from pH 7.3 to approximately pH 6 abolished responses to icilin and cold stimulation but did not affect responses to menthol. Icilin concentration-response curves were significantly shifted to the right when pH was lowered from 7.3 to 6.9, whereas those with menthol were unaltered in solutions of pH 6.1. When cells were exposed to solutions in the range of pH 8.1-6.5, the temperature threshold for activation was elevated at higher pH and depressed at lower pH. Superfusing cells with a low subactivating concentration of icilin or menthol elevated the threshold for cold activation at pH 7.4, but cooling failed to evoke [Ca2+]i responses at pH 6 in the presence of either agonist. In voltage-clamp experiments in which the intracellular pH was buffered to different levels, acidification reduced the current amplitude of icilin responses and shifted the threshold for cold activation to lower values with half-maximal inhibition at pH 7.2 and pH 7.6. The results demonstrate that the activation of TRPM8 by icilin and cold, but not menthol, is modulated by intracellular pH in the physiological range. Furthermore, our data suggest that activation by icilin and cold involve a different mechanism to activation by menthol.
15198480	Six missense mutations of the epithelial sodium channel beta and gamma subunits in Japanese hypertensives.	Liddle's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by sodium-sensitive early hypertension and mutations in either the beta- or gamma-subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel encoded by SCNN1B and SCNN1G. We sequenced the 381 bp-coding regions in exon 13 of SCNN1B and the 381 bp-coding regions in exon 12 of SCNN1G in 948 and 953 Japanese patients with hypertension, respectively. In the SCNN1B gene, we identified three missense mutations, P592S (n=3), T594M (n=2), and E632K (n=1) in a heterozygous state in addition to four synonymous ones, Ile515 (n=1), Ser520 (n=19), Ser533 (n=1), and Thr594 (n=11). In the SCNN1G gene, we identified three missense mutations, A578V (n=1), P603S (n=1), and L609F (n=1) in a heterozygous state in addition to two synonymous ones, Ile550 (n=1) and Leu649 (n= 91, heterozygous; n=2, homozygous). We did not identify the same mutations previously reported in Liddle's syndrome kindreds. Two of the six hypertensive patients with missense mutation in the SCNN1B gene showed atypical renin and aldosterone levels, though one of them was diagnosed with renovascular hypertension. One patient with T594M in the SCNN1B gene was resistant to hypertension. The roles of these missense mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene identified in hypertensive patients are not clear in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the regulation of electrolytes. Thus, further investigation of these mutations, including functional analyses, will be needed.
15219283	Synthesis and evaluation of (S)-2-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)-4-([3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl]-methyl)-benzoic acid ([18F]repaglinide): a promising radioligand for quantification of pancreatic beta-cell mass with positron emission tomography (PET).	18F-labeled non-sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent (S)-2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)-4-((3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butylcarbamoyl)-methyl)-benzoic acid ([(18)F]repaglinide), a derivative of the sulfonylurea-receptor (SUR) ligand repaglinide, was synthesized as a potential tracer for the non-invasive investigation of the sulfonylurea 1 receptor status of pancreatic beta-cells by positron emission tomography (PET) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. [(18)F]Repaglinide could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield (RCY) of 20% after 135 min with a radiochemical purity higher than 98% applying the secondary labeling precursor 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate. Specific activity was in the range of 50-60 GBq/micromol. Labeling was conducted by exchanging the ethoxy-moiety into a 2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy group. To characterize the properties of fluorinated repaglinide, the affinity of the analogous non-radioactive (19)F-compound for binding to the human SUR1 isoform was assessed. [(19)F]Repaglinide induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 (1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 134 nM. Biological activity was proven via insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets and was comparable to that of repaglinide. Finally, biodistribution of [(18)F]repaglinide was investigated in rats by measuring the concentration of the compound in different organs after i.v. injection. Pancreatic tissue displayed a stable accumulation of approximately 0.12% of the injected dose from 10 min to 30 min p.i. 50% of the radioactive tracer could be displaced by additional injection of unlabeled repaglinide, indicating that [(18)F]repaglinide might be suitable for in vivo investigation with PET.
15219414	Oxandrolone blocks glucocorticoid signaling in an androgen receptor-dependent manner.	The anabolic steroid oxandrolone is increasingly used to preserve or restore muscle mass in those with HIV infection or serious burns. These effects are mediated, in part, by the androgen receptor (AR). Anti-glucocorticoid effects have also been reported for some anabolic steroids, and the goal of our studies was to determine whether oxandrolone had a similar mechanism of action. Studies with in vitro translated glucocorticoid receptor (GR), however, showed no inhibition of cortisol binding by oxandrolone. Conversely, experiments in cell culture systems demonstrated significant antagonism of cortisol-induced transcriptional activation by oxandrolone in cells expressing both the AR and GR. Inhibition was not overcome by increased cortisol concentration, and no inhibition by oxandrolone was observed in cells expressing GR alone, confirming that non-competitive mechanisms were involved. AR-dependent repression of transcriptional activation by oxandrolone was also observed with the synthetic glucocorticoids dexamethasone and methylprednisolone. Furthermore, the AR antagonists 2-hydroxyflutamide and DDE also repressed GR transactivation in an AR-dependent manner. A mutant AR lacking a functional nuclear localization signal (AR(4RKM)) was active in oxandrolone-mediated repression of GR even though oxandrolone-bound AR(4RKM) failed to enter the nucleus and did not affect nuclear import of GR. These data indicate a novel action of oxandrolone to suppress glucocorticoid action via crosstalk between AR and GR.
15229223	Melatonin, an endogenous-specific inhibitor of estrogen receptor alpha via calmodulin.	Melatonin is an indole hormone produced mainly by the pineal gland. We have previously demonstrated that melatonin interferes with estrogen (E(2)) signaling in MCF7 cells by impairing estrogen receptor (ER) pathways. Here we present the characterization of its mechanism of action showing that melatonin is a specific inhibitor of E(2)-induced ERalpha-mediated transcription in both estrogen response element- and AP1-containing promoters, whereas ERbeta-mediated transactivation is not inhibited or even activated at certain promoters. We show that the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to melatonin depends on the ERalpha/ERbeta ratio, and ectopic expression of ERbeta results in MCF-7 cells becoming insensitive to this hormone. Melatonin acts as a calmodulin antagonist inducing conformational changes in the ERalpha-calmodulin (CaM) complex, thus impairing the binding of E(2).ERalpha.CaM complex to DNA and, therefore, preventing ERalpha-dependent transcription. Moreover the mutant ERalpha (K302G,K303G), unable to bind calmodulin, becomes insensitive to melatonin. The effect of melatonin is specific since other related indoles neither interact with CaM nor inhibit ERalpha-mediated transactivation. Interestingly, melatonin does not affect the binding of coactivators to ERalpha, indicating that melatonin action is different from that of current therapeutic anti-estrogens used in breast cancer therapy. Thus, they target ERalpha at different levels, representing two independent ways to control ERalpha activity. It is, therefore, conceivably a synergistic pharmacological effect of melatonin and current anti-estrogen drugs.
15236580	Structural details on the binding of antihypertensive drugs captopril and enalaprilat to human testicular angiotensin I-converting enzyme.	Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a critical role in the circulating or endocrine renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as well as the local regulation that exists in tissues such as the myocardium and skeletal muscle. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of testis ACE (tACE) in complex with the first successfully designed ACE inhibitor captopril and enalaprilat, the Phe-Ala-Pro analogue. We have compared these structures with the recently reported structure of a tACE-lisinopril complex [Natesh et al. (2003) Nature 421, 551-554]. The analyses reveal that all three inhibitors make direct interactions with the catalytic Zn(2+) ion at the active site of the enzyme: the thiol group of captopril and the carboxylate group of enalaprilat and lisinopril. Subtle differences are also observed at other regions of the binding pocket. These are compared with N-domain models and discussed with reference to published biochemical data. The chloride coordination geometries of the three structures are discussed and compared with other ACE analogues. It is anticipated that the molecular details provided by these structures will be used to improve the binding and/or the design of new, more potent domain-specific inhibitors of ACE that could serve as new generation antihypertensive drugs.
15242819	Increased human cytomegalovirus replication in fibroblasts after treatment with therapeutical plasma concentrations of valproic acid.	Valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid, VPA), an effective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC) is used for the treatment of epilepsia. In this study, structure-activity relationships for the action of structurally modified VPA derivatives on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication and HDAC inhibition were defined. Pretreatment of human foreskin fibroblasts with VPA (0.125-1mM) caused a concentration-dependent increase of HCMV immediate early and antigen late antigen expression. Structure-activity relationships of VPA derivatives for HCMV stimulation were compared to those for teratogenic action and those for HDAC inhibition. Side chain elongation and introduction of a triple bond in 4-position of the other chain caused teratogenicity, stimulated HCMV replication, and increased HDAC inhibition, as demonstrated by enhanced levels of acetylated histones. Teratogenic VPA derivatives with a branched chain in 3-position as well as a non-teratogenic anticonvulsive active VPA derivative did not stimulate HCMV or accumulation of acetylated histones. This demonstrates a strict correlation between inhibition of HDAC and increased HCMV replication.
15256478	Minocycline exerts multiple inhibitory effects on vascular endothelial growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration: the role of ERK1/2, PI3K, and matrix metalloproteinases.	Widely used tetracycline antibiotics affect many cellular functions relevant to human vascular disease including cell proliferation, migration, and matrix remodeling. We examined whether minocycline inhibited human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). After the establishment of an optimal dose, minocycline treated HASMC were exposed to VEGF. HASMC migration, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation were determined by smooth muscle cell (SMC) invasion assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, zymograms, and Western blot analysis, respectively. We demonstrated that VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced SMC migration in a dose-dependent manner. MMP-9, but not MMP-2, mRNA was increased during VEGF stimulation. MMP-9 activity was increased from 1.5- to 2.5-fold in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Both ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKt pathways were activated during VEGF-induced HASMCs migration. We then demonstrated that minocycline can inhibit VEGF-induced HASMC migration (P<0.05). The effects may be through the inhibition of MMP-9 mRNA transcription, protein activities and downregulation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylation. Our results indicated that minocycline exerts multiple effects on VEGF-induced SMC migration, including inhibition of MMP-9 mRNA transcription and protein activities and downregulating ERK1/2 and PI3K signal pathways, suggesting minocycline may be a potentially therapeutic approach to inhibit disease process induced angiogenesis.
15258254	Cellular trafficking of human alpha1a-adrenergic receptors is continuous and primarily agonist-independent.	Alpha1a-adrenergic receptors (alpha1aARs) are present intracellularly and at the cell surface in cultured and natural cell models, where they are subject to agonist-mediated desensitization and internalization. To explore alpha1aAR trafficking, a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged alpha1aAR/enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein was expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts and tracked by EGFP fluorescence and antibody labeling of surface receptors. Confocal analysis of antibody-labeled surface receptors revealed unexpected constitutive internalization in the absence of agonist stimulation. In partial agreement, the inverse agonist prazosin also caused a modest 20 +/- 2% increase in surface receptor levels, suggesting a partial block of constitutive internalization caused by decreased basal activation. However, prazosin was unable to prevent internalization of antibody-tagged surface receptors observed by confocal microscopy or cause obvious redistribution of intracellular receptor to the surface, suggesting that the alpha1aAR is internalizing even in a basal-inactive state. In contrast to the alpha1aAR, surface labeling of an HA-tagged alpha1b-EGFP fusion protein did not result in any apparent constitutive internalization. Constitutive internalization of the alpha1aAR seems to occur alongside reversible agonist-induced internalization, and both seem to involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis but not degradation in lysozymes. Surface receptor density must be maintained by recycling, because the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide has no effect on total or surface receptor density in agonist-treated or untreated cells for 6 h. Constitutive agonist-independent trafficking of alpha1aARs may provide a novel mechanism by which an internal pool of alpha1aARs are maintained and recycled to allow continuous agonist-induced signaling.
15261304	Comparative evaluation of androgen and progesterone receptor transcription selectivity indices of 19-nortestosterone-derived progestins.	Synthetic 19-nortestosterone-derived progestins show affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) and retain varying degrees of androgenic activity. In this study, AR- and progesterone receptor (PR)-dependent transcriptional activation induced by norethisterone (NET), levonorgestrel (LNG) and gestodene (GSD), and their 5alpha-reduced derivatives, including limited trypsin digestion of AR in the presence of natural and synthetic progestins were investigated. The results confirmed the progestogenic activity of the three 19-nortestosterone derivatives, which decreases after reduction of the 4-ene-double bound. These compounds were able to activate AR-dependent reporter gene expression, LNG and GSD being the stronger activators. 5alpha-Reduction of LNG and GSD did not change their androgenic transcriptional activity; however, the activation of AR by 5alpha-NET was four-fold higher than NET. The highest selectivity transcriptional index, as a measure of progestogenicity versus androgenicity, was obtained for NET. The 5alpha-reduced derivatives had values significantly lower than those of their parent compounds. Non-reduced and 5alpha-reduced 19-nortestosterone progestins induced virtually identical proteolysis fragmentation patterns of the AR to those observed with DHT.
15266014	Structural determinants of HERG channel block by clofilium and ibutilide.	Block of human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) K(+) channels by a variety of medications has been linked to acquired long QT syndrome, a disorder of cardiac repolarization that predisposes to lethal arrhythmias. The drug-binding site is composed of residues that face into the central cavity of the channel. Two aromatic residues located on the S6 domain (Tyr652 and Phe656) are particularly important structural determinants of drug block. The role of pore helix residues (Thr623, Ser624, Val625) is less clear. In this study, we compared the pharmacological properties of two structurally related compounds, ibutilide and clofilium. Both compounds are charged amines with a single phenyl ring. Clofilium, a chlorobenzene derivative, is a potent blocker of HERG channels, but has a remarkably slower time course for recovery from block than ibutilide, a methanesulfonanilide. The difference in the rate of recovery from block can be explained simply by variation in drug trapping. There is little recovery from clofilium block with D540K HERG channels that permit untrapping at hyperpolarized potentials. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the S6 domain and a portion of the pore helix revealed that the binding site residues were the same for both compounds. However, S624A, located at the base of the pore helix, was the only HERG mutation that enabled rapid recovery from clofilium block. In summary, the pore helix residues are important components of the HERG drug binding site, and may be particularly important for drugs with polar substituents, such as a halogen (e.g., clofilium) or a methanesulfonamide (e.g., ibutilide).
15269827	Pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel after administration of a high loading dose.	The adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor P2Y12 blocking agent clopidogrel is clinically proven to be efficient in preventing thrombotic events. However, its therapeutic value is limited by an, as yet poorly explained, interindividual heterogeneity in platelet inhibition. To evaluate possible pharmacokinetic determinants of this response variability, we developed a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for quantification of unmodified inactive clopidogrel, its inactive carboxyl metabolite, and its active thiol metabolite in plasma. Analyte concentrations and platelet aggregation were assessed in ten healthy volunteers receiving an oral load of 600 mg clopidogrel. Subjects showed marked inter-individual differences in maximal platelet inhibition and in plasma pharmacokinetics. Univariate regression revealed linear correlations between maximal antiplatelet effect and peak plasma concentrations (cmax) of unchanged clopidogrel (r=0.76; p=0.01), of the carboxyl metabolite (r=0.70; p=0.03), and of the thiol metabolite (r=0.73; p=0.02), as well as linear correlations between cmax values of clopidogrel and its metabolites. This indicates that the response variability is predominantly caused by individual differences in clopidogrel absorption and that other factors, such as ADP receptor reactivity or differences in bioactivation of clopidogrel, do not play a major role.
15272045	State-dependent trapping of flecainide in the cardiac sodium channel.	Flecainide is a Class I antiarrhythmic drug and a potent inhibitor of the cardiac (Nav1.5) sodium channel. Although the flecainide inhibition of Nav1.5 is typically enhanced by depolarization, the contributions of the open and inactivated states to flecainide binding and inhibition remain controversial. We further investigated the state-dependent binding of flecainide by examining its inhibition of rapidly inactivating and non-inactivating mutants of Nav1.5 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Applying flecainide while briefly depolarizing from a relatively negative holding potential resulted in a low-affinity inhibition of the channel (IC(50) = 345 microM). Increasing the frequency of stimulation potentiated the flecainide inhibition (IC(50) = 7.4 microM), which progressively increased over the range of voltages where Nav1.5 channels activated. This contrasts with sustained depolarizations that effectively stabilize the channels in inactivated states, which failed to promote significant flecainide inhibition. The voltage sensitivity and strong dependence of the flecainide inhibition on repetitive depolarization suggests that flecainide binding is facilitated by channel opening and that the drug does not directly bind to closed or inactivated channels. The binding of flecainide to open channels was further investigated in a non-inactivating mutant of Nav1.5. Flecainide produced a time-dependent decay in the current of the non-inactivating mutant that displayed kinetics consistent with a simple pore blocking mechanism (K(D) = 11 microM). At hyperpolarized voltages, flecainide slowed the recovery of both the rapidly inactivating (tau = 81 +/- 3 s) and non-inactivating (tau = 42 +/- 3 s) channels. Mutation of a conserved isoleucine of the D4S6 segment (I1756C) creates an alternative pathway that permits the rapid diffusion of anaesthetics out of the Nav1.5 channel. The I1756C mutation accelerated the recovery of both the rapidly inactivating (tau = 12.6 +/- 0.4 s) and non-inactivating (tau = 7.4 +/- 0.1 s) channels, suggesting that flecainide is trapped and not tightly bound within the pore when the channels are closed or inactivated. The data indicate that flecainide rapidly gains access to its binding site when the channel is open and inhibits Na(+) current by a pore blocking mechanism. Closing of either the activation or the inactivation gate traps flecainide within the pore resulting in the slow recovery of the drug-modified channels at hyperpolarized voltages.
15272206	Validation of a [3H]astemizole binding assay in HEK293 cells expressing HERG K+ channels.	A radioligand binding assay for the HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) K(+) channel was developed to identify compounds which may have inhibitory activity and potential cardiotoxicity. Pharmacological characterization of the [(3)H]astemizole binding assay for HERG K(+) channels was performed using HERG-expressing HEK293 cells. The assay conditions employed yielded 90% specific binding using 10 microg/well of membrane protein with 1.5 nM of [(3)H]astemizole at 25 degrees C. The K(d) and B(max) values were 5.91 +/- 0.81 nM and 6.36 +/- 0.26 pmol/mg, respectively. The intraassay and interassay variations were 11.4% and 14.9%, respectively. Binding affinities for 32 reference compounds (including dofetilide, cisapride, and terfenadine) with diverse structures demonstrated a similar potency rank order for HERG inhibition to that reported in the literature. Moreover, the [(3)H]astemizole binding data demonstrated a rank order of affinity that was highly correlated to that of inhibitory potency in the electrophysiological studies for HERG in HEK293 (r(SP) = 0.91, P<0.05). In conclusion, the [(3)H]astemizole binding assay is rapid and capable of detecting HERG inhibitors.
15276617	Rapid yeast estrogen bioassays stably expressing human estrogen receptors alpha and beta, and green fluorescent protein: a comparison of different compounds with both receptor types.	Previously, we described the construction of a rapid yeast bioassay stably expressing human estrogen receptor (hERalpha) and yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) in response to estrogens. In the present study, the properties of this assay were further studied by testing a series of estrogenic compounds. Furthermore, a similar assay was developed based on the stable expression of human estrogen receptor beta (hERbeta). When exposed to 17beta-estradiol, the maximum transcriptional activity of the ERbeta cytosensor was only about 40% of the activity observed with ERalpha, but the concentration where half-maximal activation is reached (EC50), was about five times lower. The relative estrogenic potencies (REP), defined as the ratio between the EC50 of 17beta-estradiol and the EC50 of the compound, of the synthetic hormones dienestrol, hexestrol and especially mestranol were higher with ER, while DES was slightly more potent with ERbeta. The gestagens progesterone and medroxyprogesterone-acetate showed no response, whereas the androgen testosterone showed a very weak response. The anabolic agent, 19-nortestosterone showed a clear dose-related response with estrogen receptor but not beta. The phytoestrogens coumestrol, genistein, genistin, daidzein, daidzin and naringenin were relatively more potent with ERbeta. Ranking of the estrogenic potency with ER was: 17beta-estradiol > 8-prenylnaringenin > coumestrol > zearalenone > genistein > genistin > naringenin. The ranking with the ERbeta was: 17beta-estradiol > coumestrol > genistein > zearalenone > 8-prenylnaringen > daidzein > naringenin > genistin > daidzin. The hop estrogen 8-prenylnaringenin is relatively more potent with ERalpha. These data show that the newly developed bioassays are valuable tools for the rapid and high-throughput screening for estrogenic activity.
15280391	The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-63 gene encodes a levamisole-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit.	The anthelmintic drug levamisole causes hypercontraction of body wall muscles and lethality in nematode worms. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetic screen for levamisole resistance has identified 12 genes, three of which (unc-38, unc-29, and lev-1) encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Here we describe the molecular and functional characterization of another levamisole-resistant gene, unc-63, encoding a nAChR alpha subunit with a predicted amino acid sequence most similar to that of UNC-38. Like UNC-38 and UNC-29, UNC-63 is expressed in body wall muscles. In addition, UNC-63 is expressed in vulval muscles and neurons. We also show that LEV-1 is expressed in body wall muscle, thus overlapping the cellular localization of UNC-63, UNC-38, and UNC-29 and suggesting possible association in vivo. This is supported by electrophysiological studies on body wall muscle, which demonstrate that a levamisole-sensitive nAChR present at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction requires both UNC-63 and LEV-1 subunits. Thus, at least four subunits, two alpha types (UNC-38 and UNC-63) and two non-alpha types (UNC-29 and LEV-1), can contribute to levamisole-sensitive muscle nAChRs in nematodes.
15286207	Molecular determinants of frequency dependence and Ca2+ potentiation of verapamil block in the pore region of Cav1.2.	Verapamil block of Ca(v)1.2 is frequency-dependent and potentiated by Ca(2+). We examined the molecular determinants of these characteristics using mutations that effect Ca(2+) interactions with Ca(v)1.2. Mutant and wild-type Ca(v)1.2 channels were transiently expressed in tsA 201 cells with beta(1b) and alpha(2)delta subunits. The four conserved glutamates that compose the Ca(2+) selectivity filter in Ca(v)1.2 were mutated to Gln (E363Q, E709Q, E1118Q, E1419Q) and the adjacent conserved threonine in each domain was mutated to Ala (T361A, T707A, T1116A, T1417A). The L-type-specific residues in the domain III pore region (F1117G) and the C-terminal tail (I1627A) were also mutated and assayed for block by verapamil using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in 10 mM Ba(2+) or 10 mM Ca(2+). In Ba(2+), none of the pore-region mutations reduced the fraction of current blocked by 30 microM verapamil at 0.05 Hz stimulation. However, all of the pore-region mutations abolished Ca(2+) potentiation of verapamil block at 0.05 Hz. The T1116A, F1117G, E1118Q, and E1419Q mutations all significantly reduced frequency-dependent verapamil block (1-Hz stimulation) in both Ba(2+) and Ca(2+). The I1627A mutation, which disrupts Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation, increased the fraction of closed channels blocked by 30 microM verapamil in Ba(2+) but did not affect frequency-dependent block in Ba(2+) or Ca(2+). Our data suggest that the pore region of domain III may contribute to a high affinity verapamil binding site accessed during 1-Hz stimulation and that Ca(2+) binding to multiple sites may be required for potentiation of verapamil block of closed channels.
15289798	Valproic acid inhibits histone deacetylase activity and suppresses excitotoxicity-induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation and apoptotic death in neurons.	Valproic acid (VPA), used to treat bipolar mood disorder and seizures, also inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC). Here, we found that VPA and other HDAC inhibitors, butyrate and trichostatin A, robustly protected mature cerebellar granule cell cultures from excitotoxicity induced by SYM 2081 ((2S, 4R)-4-methylglutamate), an inhibitor of excitatory amino-acid transporters and an agonist of low-affinity kainate receptors. These neuroprotective effects required protracted treatment and were correlated with enhanced acetylated histone levels, indicating HDAC inhibition. SYM-induced excitotoxicity was blocked by MK-801 ((5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate), supporting that the toxicity was largely N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dependent. SYM excitotoxicity had apoptotic characteristics and was prevented by a caspase inhibitor. SYM-induced apoptosis was associated with a rapid and robust nuclear accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a housekeeping gene previously shown to be proapoptotic. VPA pretreatment suppressed SYM 2081-induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation, concurrent with its neuroprotective effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that GAPDH is copresent with acetylated histone H3, including Lys9-acetylated histone, and that VPA treatment caused a time-dependent decrease in the levels of nuclear GAPDH with a concomitant increase in acetylated histones in the ChIP complex. Our results strongly suggest that VPA protects neurons from excitotoxicity through inhibition of HDAC activity and that this protective effect may involve suppression of excitotoxicity-induced accumulation of GAPDH protein in the nucleus.
15289999	Anxiolytic properties of agomelatine, an antidepressant with melatoninergic and serotonergic properties: role of 5-HT2C receptor blockade.	The novel antidepressant agent, agomelatine, behaves as an agonist at melatonin receptors and as an antagonist at serotonin (5-HT)(2C) receptors.
15300361	Binding of [3H]mazindol to cardiac norepinephrine transporters: kinetic and equilibrium studies.	The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is the carrier that drives the neuronal norepinephrine uptake mechanism (uptake1) in mammalian hearts. The radioligand [3H]mazindol binds with high affinity to NET. In this study, the kinetics of [3H]mazindol binding to NET were measured using a rat heart membrane preparation. Results from these studies were used to set up saturation binding assays designed to measure cardiac NET densities (Bmax) and competitive inhibition assays designed to measure inhibitor binding affinities (KI) for NET. Saturation binding assays measured NET densities in rat, rabbit, and canine hearts. Assay reproducibility was assessed and the effect of NaCl concentration on [3H]mazindol binding to NET was studied using membranes from rat and canine hearts. Specificity of [3H]mazindol binding to NET was determined in experiments in which the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was used to selectively destroy cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals in rats. Competitive inhibition studies measured KI values for several NET inhibitors and substrates. In kinetic studies using rat heart membranes, [3H]mazindol exhibited a dissociation rate constant koff=0.0123+/-0.0007 min(-1) and an association rate constant kon=0.0249+/-0.0019 nM(-1)min(-1). In saturation binding assays, [3H]mazindol binding was monophasic and saturable in all cases. Increasing the concentration of NaCl in the assay buffer increased binding affinity significantly, while only modestly increasing Bmax. Injections of 6-OHDA in rats decreased measured cardiac NET Bmax values in a dose-dependent manner, verifying that [3H]mazindol binds specifically to NET from sympathetic nerve terminals. Competitive inhibition studies provided NET inhibitor and substrate KI values consistent with previously reported values. These studies demonstrate the high selectivity of [3H]mazindol binding for the norepinephrine transporter in membrane preparations from mammalian hearts.
15306222	Carvedilol selectively inhibits oscillatory intracellular calcium changes evoked by human alpha1D- and alpha1B-adrenergic receptors.	Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that carvedilol, an antagonist of alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), provides an effective treatment for chronic heart failure, whereas nonselective alpha1-AR blockade has an adverse outcome in this disease. It is, however, not clear whether carvedilol exhibits a subtype-dependent impact on three distinct alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1-ARs).
15306243	Diazoxide prevents mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ accumulation in CA1 pyramidal cells after cerebral ischemia in newborn pigs.	Diazoxide (DIAZ), an opener of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (mK(ATP)), protects neurons against hypoxic/ischemic stress in vivo, however, direct evidence showing mitochondrial effects of DIAZ in postischemic neurons is lacking. We investigated if DIAZ affects mitochondrial alterations after global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in CA1 pyramidal neurons by using oxalate-pyroantimonate electron cytochemistry. Anesthetized piglets were either non-treated, or treated with DIAZ (3 mg/kg, iv), I/R, DIAZ+I/R, or 5-hydroxy-decanoate (5HD)+DIAZ+I/R (n=6, 6, 11, 5, 7, respectively). Ischemia (10 min) was induced by intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation. After 5-30 min of reperfusion, the brains were fixed for ultrastructural studies. Relative volumes of Ca(2+)-containing deposits and mitochondria in CA1 pyramidal cells were determined by point counting on electron micrographs. I/R resulted in maximal increases in mitochondrial volume (from 7.14+/-0.63% to 9.74+/-0.57%*), and Ca(2+) levels (from 5.86+/-1.11% to 11.39+/-1.35%*; mean+/-S.E.M., *p<0.05) at 10-15-min reperfusion time. In this interval, pretreatment with DIAZ virtually abolished mitochondrial swelling (6.88+/-0.49%) and Ca(2+) accumulation (5.15+/-0.82%) evoked by I/R. The protective effect of DIAZ was reduced by 5HD, an inhibitor of mK(ATP), resulting in a calcium accumulation similar to that after IR (10.44+/-1.98%). Thus, DIAZ might preserve mitochondrial integrity in CA1 pyramidal cells after I/R, at least in part mediated by mK(ATP).
15311065	Cool (TRPM8) and hot (TRPV1) receptors in the bladder and male genital tract.	Overactive bladder symptoms due to various etiologies have been successfully treated with capsaicin by desensitization of the temperature sensitive vanilloid receptor TRPV1. Recently another temperature sensitive receptor, TRPM8, activated by menthol and cool temperatures (8C to 28C) was described that may be the proposed cool receptor, at least in part mediating the bladder response in the diagnostic ice water test. We defined the sites of mRNA and protein expression of TRPM8 and TRPV1 in the rat and human genitourinary tract.
15314102	Fluconazole binding and sterol demethylation in three CYP51 isoforms indicate differences in active site topology.	14alpha-Demethylase (CYP51) is a key enzyme in all sterol biosynthetic pathways (animals, fungi, plants, protists, and some bacteria), catalyzing the removal of the C-14 methyl group following cyclization of squalene. Based on mutations found in CYP51 genes from Candida albicans azole-resistant isolates obtained after fluconazole treatment of fungal infections, and using site-directed mutagenesis, we have found that fluconazole binding and substrate metabolism vary among three different CYP51 isoforms: human, fungal, and mycobacterial. In C. albicans, the Y132H mutant from isolates shows no effect on fluconazole binding, whereas the F145L mutant results in a 5-fold increase in its IC(50) for fluconazole, suggesting that F145 (conserved only in fungal 14alpha-demethylases) interacts with this azole. In C. albicans, F145L accounts, in part, for the difference in fluconazole sensitivity reported between mammals and fungi, providing a basis for treatment of fungal infections. The C. albicans Y132H and human Y145H CYP51 mutants show essentially no effect on substrate metabolism, but the Mycobacterium tuberculosis F89H CYP51 mutant loses both its substrate binding and metabolism. Because these three residues align in the three isoforms, the results indicate that their active sites contain important structural differences, and further emphasize that fluconazole and substrate binding are uncoupled properties.
15330152	Inhibition of the human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) repair activity and sensitization of breast cancer cells to DNA alkylating agents with lucanthone.	Cells repair DNA damage via four main mechanisms, however, damage induced by alkylators and oxidative damage is predominantly repaired by the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. The AP endonuclease, APE1, is one of the main enzymes in the BER pathway. It is abundant in human cells and accounts for nearly all of the abasic site cleavage activity observed in cellular extracts. APE1 expression is elevated in a variety of cancers and a high APE1 expression has been associated with poor outcome to chemoradiotherapy. The small molecule lucanthone has been shown to enhance the killing ability of ionizing radiation in cells and preliminary evidence suggests that lucanthone may inhibit AP endonuclease. Given the role APE1 plays in repairing oxidative and ionizing radiation DNA damage, the reports of lucanthone as an ionizing radiation enhancer and the potential use of lucanthone as an AP endonuclease inhibitor, we examined whether lucanthone could inhibit APE1 endonuclease activity. We report that lucanthone inhibits the repair activity of APE1, but not its redox function or exonuclease activity on mismatched nucleotides. Lucanthone also appears to inhibit exonuclease III family members (APE1 and ExoIII), but not endonuclease IV AP endonucleases, nor bifunctional glycosylase/lyases such as endonuclease VIII or formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). Furthermore, the addition of lucanthone inhibits APE1 repair activity from cellular extracts and enhances the cell killing effect of the laboratory alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and the clinically relevant agent temozolomide (TMZ). Given these initial findings, it would be of interest to further develop lucanthone as an APE1 inhibitor through the use of structure-function studies as a means of enhancing the sensitization of tumors to chemotherapeutic agents.
15332709	The contribution of a novel ribosomal S12 mutation to aminoglycoside resistance of Escherichia coli mutants.	This study characterised the contribution of a novel ribosomal S12 mutation to aminoglycoside resistance in Escherichia coli via step-wise mutation analysis. Mutants of E. coli NCTC 10418 were selected in four separate progressive series (I-IV) on plates containing increasing aminoglycoside (streptomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin) concentrations. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these aminoglycosides were established for the most resistant mutants in each series. There was no cross-resistance between streptomycin and the other aminoglycosides tested; however there was cross-resistance between the neomycin, tobramycin and kanamycin resistant mutants. DNA sequencing of a 423bp region of the rpsL gene encoding S12 revealed a novel Lys87-->Glu mutation in the streptomycin selected resistant mutants, while there were no S12 mutations in resistant mutants resulting from selection with neomycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin and kanamycin.
15353401	Minocycline reduces renal microvascular leakage in a rat model of ischemic renal injury.	Tetracyclines exhibit significant anti-inflammatory properties, inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and are protective in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Both inflammatory cascades and MMP activation have been demonstrated to modulate microvascular permeability. Because increased microvascular permeability occurs during IRI in a variety of organ systems including the kidney, we hypothesized that minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, would diminish microvascular leakage during renal IRI. To test this hypothesis, we used intravital 2-photon microscopy to examine leakage of fluorescent dextrans from the vasculature in a rodent model of IRI. Minocycline significantly reduced the extent of dextran (500 kDa) leakage from the renal microvasculature 24 h after ischemia. Although minocycline diminished leukocyte accumulation in the kidney following ischemia, areas of leukocyte accumulation did not correlate with areas of microvascular permeability in either the saline- or minocycline-pretreated animals. Minocycline diminished the perivascular increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as the increase in MMP-2 activity 24 h after ischemia. ABT-518, a specific inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9, also significantly reduced the extent of dextran (500 kDa) leakage from the renal microvasculature 24 h after ischemia. Our results indicate that minocycline mitigates the renal microvascular permeability defect following IRI. This effect is spatially distinct from the effect of minocycline on leukocyte accumulation and may be related to diminished activity of MMPs on the integrity of the perivascular matrix.
15353592	Different functional roles of T1R subunits in the heteromeric taste receptors.	The T1R receptors, a family of taste-specific class C G protein-coupled receptors, mediate mammalian sweet and umami tastes. The structure-function relationships of T1R receptors remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the different functional roles of T1R extracellular and transmembrane domains in ligand recognition and G protein coupling. Similar to other family C G protein-coupled receptors, the N-terminal Venus flytrap domain of T1R2 is required for recognizing sweeteners, such as aspartame and neotame. The G protein coupling requires the transmembrane domain of T1R2. Surprisingly, the C-terminal transmembrane domain of T1R3 is required for recognizing sweetener cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. Because T1R3 is the common subunit in the sweet taste receptor and the umami taste receptor, we tested the interaction of lactisole and cyclamate with the umami taste receptor. Lactisole inhibits the activity of the human T1R1/T1R3 receptor, and, as predicted, blocked the umami taste of l-glutamate in human taste tests. Cyclamate does not activate the T1R1/T1R3 receptor by itself, but potentiates the receptor's response to l-glutamate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the different functional roles of T1R3 and T1R2 and the presence of multiple ligand binding sites on the sweet taste receptor.
15358223	Inhibitory effect of n-3 fish oil fatty acids on cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents in HEK293t cells.	Abnormal activity of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) can affect intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and cause arrhythmias. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), however, may prevent arrhythmias. To test the effect of PUFAs on the cardiac NCX1 current (I(NCX1)), the canine NCX1 cDNA was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293t) cells. The average density of I(NCX1) was 10.9+/-2.6 pA/pF (n=44) in NCX1-transfected cells and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) significantly inhibited I(NCX1) The suppression of I(NCX1) by EPA was concentration-dependent with an IC50 of 0.82+/-0.27 microM. EPA had a similar effect on outward or inward I(NCX1). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4n-6) also significantly inhibited I(NCX1), whereas the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid (SA, C18:0), did not. Our data demonstrate that the n-3 PUFAs significantly suppress cardiac I(NCX1), which is probably one of their protective effects against lethal arrhythmias.
15365090	Inhibition of Na+-K+ pump and L-type Ca2+ channel by glibenclamide in Guinea pig ventricular myocytes.	Glibenclamide, a potent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel blocker, is frequently used to study function and regulation of CFTR Cl(-) channels. In this study, the effects of glibenclamide on intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)), contraction, Ca(2+) transient, and membrane potential were investigated in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Glibenclamide increased [Na(+)](i) and decreased contraction and Ca(2+) transient. However, glibenclamide did not change membrane potential. To determine whether inhibition of Na(+)-K(+) pumps and L-type Ca(2+) channels is responsible for the increase of [Na(+)](i) and the decrease of contraction, we tested the effects of glibenclamide on Na(+)-K(+) pump current and L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)). Glibenclamide decreased Na(+)-K(+) pump current and I(Ca,L) in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of Cl(-) channel inhibitors, glibenclamide depolarized diastolic membrane potential and reduced action potential duration. This result suggests that the reason for lack of effect of glibenclamide on membrane potential might be due to its combined inhibitory effects on the Na(+)-K(+) pump, the L-type Ca(2+) channel, and Cl(-) channels, which may have opposing effects on membrane potential. These results indicate that glibenclamide increases [Na(+)(i)] by inhibiting the Na(+)-K(+) pump and decreases contraction and Ca(2+) transient, in addition, by blocking the L-type Ca(2+) channel.
15374980	A unique structure for epidermal growth factor receptor bound to GW572016 (Lapatinib): relationships among protein conformation, inhibitor off-rate, and receptor activity in tumor cells.	GW572016 (Lapatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development for cancer that is a potent dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB-1) and ErbB-2. We determined the crystal structure of EGFR bound to GW572016. The compound is bound to an inactive-like conformation of EGFR that is very different from the active-like structure bound by the selective EGFR inhibitor OSI-774 (Tarceva) described previously. Surprisingly, we found that GW572016 has a very slow off-rate from the purified intracellular domains of EGFR and ErbB-2 compared with OSI-774 and another EGFR selective inhibitor, ZD-1839 (Iressa). Treatment of tumor cells with these inhibitors results in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. We evaluated the duration of the drug effect after washing away free compound and found that the rate of recovery of receptor phosphorylation in the tumor cells reflected the inhibitor off-rate from the purified intracellular domain. The slow off-rate of GW572016 correlates with a prolonged down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells. The differences in the off-rates of these drugs and the ability of GW572016 to inhibit ErbB-2 can be explained by the enzyme-inhibitor structures.
15377641	Characterization of the renal tubular transport of zonampanel, a novel alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor antagonist, by human organic anion transporters.	Zonampanel monohydrate (YM872; [2,3-dioxo-7-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-quinoxalinyl]acetic acid monohydrate) is a novel alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist. The major elimination route for zonampanel has been reported to be by urine via the kidneys. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the renal excretion of zonampanel using cells stably expressing human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1, hOAT2, hOAT3, and hOAT4, as well as human organic cation transporters (hOCT) 1 and hOCT2. Another AMPA receptor antagonist, YM90K [6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-7-nitro-2,3(1H,4H)-quinoxalinedione monohydrochloride], a decarboxymethylated form of zonampanel, was also used for comparing the substrate specificity. Zonampanel inhibited the uptake of prototypical organic anion substrates, [14C]para-aminohippurate in hOAT1 and [3H]estrone sulfate in hOAT3 and hOAT4, in a competitive manner. A time- and concentration-dependent increase in [14C]zonampanel uptake was observed in cells expressing hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4. The Km values of zonampanel uptake by hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4 were 1.4, 7.7, and 215 microM, respectively. Considering the localization of each transporter, results suggest that zonampanel is taken up via hOAT1 and hOAT3 from the blood into proximal tubular cells and then effluxed into the lumen via hOAT4. Probenecid and cimetidine competitively inhibited [14C]zonampanel uptake by the hOATs (hOAT1, hOAT3, and hOAT4 for probenecid; hOAT3 for cimetidine). YM90K inhibited the uptake of the prototypical substrate via hOAT3 competitively, but the uptake via hOAT1 noncompetitively. These findings suggest that the prototypical organic anion substrates (para-aminohippurate and estrone sulfate), cimetidine, probenecid, and zonampanel share binding specificity in each hOAT, whereas YM90K does not in hOAT1, possibly due to it being the decarboxymethylated form.
15380228	Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of (S)-2-([11C]methoxy)-4-[3-methyl-1-(2-piperidine-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl]-benzoic acid ([11C]methoxy-repaglinide): a potential beta-cell imaging agent.	The 11C-labeled sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) ligand (S)-2-([11C]methoxy)-4-[3-methyl-1-(2-piperidine-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl]-benzoic acid ([11C]methoxy-repaglinide) was synthesized in an overall radiochemical yield of 35% after 55 min with a radiochemical purity higher than 99%. This compound is considered for the noninvasive investigation of the SUR1 receptor status of pancreatic beta-cells by positron emission tomography (PET) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The specific activity was 40-70 GBq/micromol. In vitro testing of the nonradioactive methoxy-repaglinide was performed to characterize the affinity for binding to the human SUR1 isoform. Methoxy-repaglinide induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 (1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (KD) of 83 nM and an IC50 of 163 nM. Insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets were performed to prove biological activity, which was determined to be in the same range as that of original repaglinide.
15456537	Montelukast modulates lung CysLT(1) receptor expression and eosinophilic inflammation in asthmatic mice.	To determine the expressions of cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2, in airway eosinophilic inflammation of OVA-induced asthmatic mice and the modulation by montelukast, a CysLT1 receptor antagonist.
15466450	The 5-HT4 receptor agonist, tegaserod, is a potent 5-HT2B receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo.	1 Tegaserod (Zelnorm) is a potent 5-hydroxytryptamine4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist with clinical efficacy in disorders associated with reduced gastrointestinal motility and transit. The present study investigated the interaction of tegaserod with 5-HT2 receptors, and compared its potency in this respect to its 5-HT4 receptor agonist activity. 2 Tegaserod had significant binding affinity for human recombinant 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors (pKi=7.5, 8.4 and 7.0, respectively). The 5-HT2B receptor-binding affinity of tegaserod was identical to that at human recombinant 5-HT4(c) receptors (mean pKi=8.4) in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells stably transfected with the human 5-HT4(c) receptor. 3 Tegaserod (0.1-3 microm) inhibited 5-HT-mediated contraction of the rat isolated stomach fundus potently (pA2=8.3), consistent with 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonist activity. Tegaserod produced, with similar potency, an elevation of adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the human 5-HT4(c) receptor (mean pEC50=8.6), as well as 5-HT4) receptor-mediated relaxation of the rat isolated oesophagus (mean pEC50=8.2) and contraction of the guinea-pig isolated colon (mean pEC50=8.3). 4 Following subcutaneous administration, tegaserod (0.3 or 1 mg kg(-1)) inhibited contractions of the stomach fundus in anaesthetized rats in response to intravenous dosing of alpha-methyl 5-HT (0.03 mg kg(-1)) and BW 723C86 (0.3 mg kg(-1)), selective 5-HT2B receptor agonists. At similar doses, tegaserod (1 and 3 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously) evoked a 5-HT4 receptor-mediated increase in colonic transit in conscious guinea-pigs. 5 The data from this study indicate that tegaserod antagonizes 5-HT2B receptors at concentrations similar to those that activate 5-HT4 receptors. It remains to be determined whether this 5-HT2B receptor antagonist activity of tegaserod contributes to its clinical profile.
15481318	Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with infliximab in Crohn's disease.	Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an ulcerating noninfectious disease of the skin seen in 1 to 5% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The pathogenesis of PG has yet to be determined but may be related to abnormal T cell responses and the production of TNF-alpha, a powerful proinflammatory cytokine. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, has been approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease. We present four patients with PG treated with Infliximab for fistulizing Crohn's in whom complete healing of PG was achieved. Four patients with active fistulizing Crohn's disease and PG were treated. All patients were females ranging in age from 48 to 60 years, with a mean age of 54 years. Three of four patients had PG lesions located on the lower extremities; one patient had peristomal disease. All patients had at least colonic involvement of their Crohn's. The patients received either a single infusion or a series of three 5 mg/kg Infliximab infusions. All four patients demonstrated rapid healing of PG within 4 weeks of the first infusion of Infliximab. PG healing followed improvement in bowel disease. Complete resolution without recurrence was noted in all patients. Rapid resolution of PG was noted in four female patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease treated with Infliximab. Healing was complete, without recurrence. The anti-TNF-alpha properties of Infliximab suggest that healing may be mediated by the drug's effect on cytokine pathways, perhaps by blunted T cell activation early in the inflammatory cascade. We suggest an independent effect of Infliximab on PG.
15481334	Effect of ibuprofen on cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase of gastric mucosa: correlation with endoscopic lesions and adverse reactions.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ibuprofen on gastric mucosa and enzymes involved in gastroprotection in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four Helicobacter pylori-negative subjects were randomized to treatment with ibuprofen or ibuprofen-arginate (each 600 mg/6 hr during 3 days). Endoscopies were performed 1 week before and after treatment. Biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum and corpus for determination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by ELISA and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and iNOS) by western blot. All subjects had at least one gastric lesion except for two individuals taking ibuprofen-arginate. Ibuprofen-arginate caused a lower rate of clinical adverse reactions than ibuprofen. Subjects with gastric lesions or adverse reactions had lower PGE2 levels. COX-1, COX-2, eNOS, and iNOS were detectable in all subjects. The constitutive enzymes (COX-1 and eNOS) did not change after treatment. COX-2 was higher in corpus than antrum and it increased after ibuprofen treatment. iNOS tended to increase mildly in the corpus in subjects with adverse reactions or endoscopic lesions. There were no significant differences between ibuprofen and ibuprofen-arginate in PGE2, or enzymes.
15483189	Development of androgen- and estrogen-responsive bioassays, members of a panel of human cell line-based highly selective steroid-responsive bioassays.	We have established highly sensitive and specific androgen and estrogen reporter cell lines which we have named AR (androgen receptor) and ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha) CALUX (Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression), respectively. Both bioassays are member of a panel of CALUX reporter cell lines derived from the human U2-OS osteosarcoma cell line, all using highly selective reporter constructs based with a basal promoter element linked to multimerized response elements, allowing efficient and specific measurement of compounds interfering with androgen, estrogen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors. The AR CALUX bioassay contains the human androgen receptor and a luciferase reporter construct containing three androgen-responsive elements coupled to a minimal TATA promoter. This cell line was characterized by its stable expression of AR protein, its highly selective response to low levels of different natural and synthetic androgens, and its insignificant response to other nuclear hormone receptor ligands such as estrogens, progestins, and glucocorticoids. The EC50 of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was found to be 0.13 nM, consistent with the high affinity of this ligand to the human AR. Flutamide, cyproterone acetate, and the environmental contaminants vinclozolin, DDT, methoxychlor, its metabolite HPTE, and penta-BFR showed clear antagonistic activity in the AR CALUX bioassay, competitively inhibiting DHT-mediated transactivation. The established AR CALUX bioassay proved to excel in terms of easy cell line maintenance, high fold induction range (typical 30 times over solvent control), low minimal detection limit (3.6 pM), and high androgen selectivity. Potential applications such as testing the androgenic or estrogenic activity of pure chemicals and pharmaceuticals and complex mixtures (environmental, food, feed, and clinical) are discussed.
15494133	Quantification of the major urinary metabolite of PGE2 by a liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay: determination of cyclooxygenase-specific PGE2 synthesis in healthy humans and those with lung cancer.	Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is a major cyclooxygenase (COX) product that is important in human physiology and pathophysiology. Quantification of systemic PG production in humans is best assessed by measuring excreted urinary metabolites. Accurate and easy-to-perform assays to quantify the major urinary metabolite of PGE2, 11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20-dioic acid (PGE-M), do not exist. We now report the development of a robust and facile method to measure urinary PGE-M excretion in humans using stable isotope dilution techniques employing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Concentrations of the metabolite in urine from healthy humans are nearly twofold greater in men than in women (10.4+/-1.5 vs. 6.0+/-0.7 ng/mg creatinine). Levels of PGE-M in healthy humans are suppressed significantly not only by the nonselective COX inhibitor ibuprofen but also by the COX-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib, suggesting that the majority of PGE2 formed in vivo is derived from COX-2. Increased COX-2 expression and increased PGE2 production are associated with malignancy. Levels of PGE-M were found to be greatly increased in humans with unresectable non-small cell cancer of the lung, and this increase is dramatically reduced by administration of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, implying that COX-2 contributes significantly to the overproduction of PGE2. In summary, quantification of PGE-M using LC/MS/MS provides a facile and accurate method to assess PGE2 formation in human physiological and pathophysiological processes.
15504856	Mutations of Pneumocystis jirovecii dihydrofolate reductase associated with failure of prophylaxis.	Most drugs used for prevention and treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia target enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of folic acid, i.e., dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Emergence of P. jirovecii drug resistance has been suggested by the association between failure of prophylaxis with sulfa drugs and mutations in DHPS. However, data on the occurrence of mutations in DHFR, the target of trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, are scarce. We examined polymorphisms in P. jirovecii DHFR from 33 patients diagnosed with P. jirovecii pneumonia who were receiving prophylaxis with a DHFR inhibitor (n = 15), prophylaxis without a DHFR inhibitor (n = 11), or no prophylaxis (n = 7). Compared to the wild-type sequence present in GenBank, 19 DHFR nucleotide substitution sites were found in 18 patients with 3 synonymous and 16 nonsynonymous mutations. Of 16 amino acid changes, 6 were located in positions conserved among distant organisms, and five of these six positions are probably involved in the putative active sites of the enzyme. Patients with failure of prophylaxis, including a DHFR inhibitor, were more likely to harbor nonsynonymous DHFR mutations than those who did not receive such prophylaxis (9 of 15 patients versus 2 of 18; P = 0.008). Analysis of the rate of nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations was consistent with selection of amino acid substitutions in patients with failure of prophylaxis including a DHFR inhibitor. The results suggest that P. jirovecii populations may evolve under selective pressure from DHFR inhibitors, in particular pyrimethamine, and that DHFR mutations may contribute to P. jirovecii drug resistance.
15514211	Probucol inhibits ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid efflux.	ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates the efflux of lipids from cells to lipid-poor apolipoproteins. In this article, we characterize the effect of probucol on cellular ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux.
15531579	Mimosine attenuates serine hydroxymethyltransferase transcription by chelating zinc. Implications for inhibition of DNA replication.	L-mimosine is a naturally occurring plant amino acid and iron chelator that arrests the cell cycle in the late G(1) phase, although its mechanism of action is not known. Some studies indicate that mimosine prevents the initiation of DNA replication, whereas other studies indicate that mimosine disrupts elongation of the replication fork by impairing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT1). In this study, the mechanism for mimosine-induced inhibition of SHMT1 transcription was elucidated. A mimosine-responsive transcriptional element was localized within the first 50 base pairs of the human SHMT1 promoter by deletion analyses and gel mobility shift assays. The 50-base-pair sequence contains a consensus zinc-sensing metal regulatory element (MRE) at position -44 to -38, and mutation of the MRE attenuated mimosine-induced transcription repression. Mimosine treatment eliminated MRE- and Sp1-binding activity in nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells but not in nuclear extracts from a mimosine-resistant cell line, MCF-7/2a. MCF-7 cells cultured in zinc-depleted medium for more than 16 days were viable and lacked cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase protein, confirming that mimosine inhibits SHMT1 transcription by chelating zinc. The disruption of DNA-protein interactions by zinc chelation provides a general mechanism for the inhibitory effects of mimosine on nuclear processes, including replication and transcription. Furthermore, this study establishes that SHMT1 is a zinc-inducible gene, which provides the first mechanism for the regulation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism by zinc.
15531591	Evidence that the fosfomycin target Cys115 in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) is essential for product release.	MurA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase, EC 2.5.1.7) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell. It provides an attractive template for the design of novel antibiotic drugs and is the target of the naturally occurring antibiotic fosfomycin, which covalently attaches to Cys115 in the active site of the enzyme. Mutations of Cys115 to Asp exist in pathogens such as Mycobacteria or Chlamydia rendering these organisms resistant to fosfomycin. Thus, there is a need for the elucidation of the role of this cysteine in the MurA reaction. We determined the x-ray structure of the C115S mutant of Enterobacter cloacae MurA, which was crystallized in the presence of the substrates of MurA. The structure depicts the product state of the enzyme with enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and inorganic phosphate trapped in the active site. Kinetic analysis revealed that the Cys-to-Ser mutation results in an enzyme that appears to perform a single turnover of the reaction. Opposing the common view of Cys115 as a key residue in the chemical reaction of enolpyruvyl transfer, we now conclude that the wild-type cysteine is essential for product release only. On the basis of a detailed comparison of the product state with the intermediate state and an unliganded state of MurA, we propose that dissociation of the products is an ordered event with inorganic phosphate leaving first. Phosphate departure appears to trigger a suite of conformational changes, which finally leads to opening of the two-domain structure of MurA and the release of the second product enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.
15537337	Piperidine-based nocaine/modafinil hybrid ligands as highly potent monoamine transporter inhibitors: efficient drug discovery by rational lead hybridization.	Some piperidine-based nocaine/modafinil hybrid ligands have been designed, synthesized, and found to display an improved potency at all three monoamine transporters and particularly for DAT and/or NET. Some highly active and selective monoamine transporter inhibitors with low nanomolar to subnanomolar potency were identified. Ligands of this type may find important applications as positron emission tomography imaging tools and in the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as depression and sleep apnea.
15537887	Acid-sensing ion channel 2 contributes a major component to acid-evoked excitatory responses in spiral ganglion neurons and plays a role in noise susceptibility of mice.	Ion channels in the degenerin-epithelial sodium channel (DEG-ENaC) family perform diverse functions, including mechanosensation. Here we explored the role of the vertebrate DEG-ENaC protein, acid-sensing ion channel 2 (ASIC2), in auditory transduction. Contributions of ASIC2 to hearing were examined by comparing hearing threshold and noise sensitivity of wild-type and ASIC2 null mice. ASIC2 null mice showed no significant hearing loss, indicating that the ASIC2 was not directly involved in the mechanotransduction of the mammalian cochlea. However, we found that (1) ASIC2 was present in the spiral ganglion (SG) neurons in the adult cochlea and that externally applied protons induced amiloride-sensitive sodium currents and action potentials in SG neurons in vitro, (2) proton-induced responses were greatly reduced in SG neurons obtained from ASIC2 null mice, indicating that activations of ASIC2 contributed a major portion of the proton-induced excitatory response in SG neurons, and (3) ASIC2 null mice were considerably more resistant to noise-induced temporary, but not permanent, threshold shifts. Together, these data suggest that ASIC2 contributes to suprathreshold functions of the cochlea. The presence of ASIC2 in SG neurons could provide sensors to directly convert local acidosis to excitatory responses, therefore offering a cellular mechanism linking hearing losses caused by many enigmatic causes (e.g., ischemia or inflammation of the inner ear) to excitotoxicity.
15548677	Inhibition of extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 is required for apoptosis of human colon cancer cells in vitro by sulindac metabolites.	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including sulindac have shown potent chemopreventive and tumor regressive effects against colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. However, the mechanisms by which sulindac inhibits tumor cell growth are not completely understood. We previously reported that sulindac metabolites inhibit the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling cascade in colorectal cancer cell lines at doses that induce apoptosis, and inhibition of MEK/ERK activity with U0126 is sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death. To determine whether inhibition of MEK/ERK activity is necessary for sulindac-induced apoptosis of human colon cancer cells, stable transfectants were created that express an activated MEK1 gene in HT29 cells. HT29-MEK1(R4F) clones displayed a 10- to 20-fold increase in MEK1 activity compared with control HT29-pCEP4 clones. When compared with control HT29-pCEP4 clones, HT29-MEK1(R4F) clones were resistant to both apoptosis and inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by sulindac metabolites. These results suggest that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by sulindac metabolites.
15548764	Discovery of a small molecule activator of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) cardiac K+ channel.	Many drugs inhibit the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) cardiac K+ channel. This leads to action potential prolongation on the cellular level, a prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, and sometimes cardiac arrhythmia. To date, no activators of this channel have been reported. Here, we describe the in vitro electrophysiological effects of (3R,4R)-4-[3-(6-methoxyquinolin-4-yl)-3-oxo-propyl]-1-[3-(2,3,5-trifluoro-phenyl)-prop-2-ynyl]-piperidine-3-carboxylic acid (RPR260243), a novel activator of HERG. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that RPR260243 dramatically slowed current deactivation when applied to cells stably expressing HERG. The effects of RPR260243 on HERG channel deactivation were temperature- and voltage-dependent and occurred over the concentration range of 1 to 30 microM. RPR260243-modified HERG currents were inhibited by dofetilide (IC50 = 58 nM). RPR260243 had little effect on HERG current amplitude and no significant effects on steady-state activation parameters or on channel inactivation processes. RPR260243 displayed no activator-like effects on other voltage-dependent ion channels, including the closely related erg3 K+ channel. RPR260243 enhanced the delayed rectifier current in guinea pig myocytes but, when administered alone, had little effect on action potential parameters in these cells. However, RPR260243 completely reversed the action potential-prolonging effects of dofetilide in this preparation. Using the Langendorff heart method, we found that 5 microM RPR260243 increased T-wave amplitude, prolonged the PR interval, and shortened the QT interval. We believe RPR260243 represents the first known HERG channel activator and that the drug works primarily by inhibiting channel closure, leading to a persistent HERG channel current upon repolarization. Compounds like RPR260243 will be useful for studying the physiological role of HERG and may one day find use in treating cardiac disease.
15550676	Phosphorylation of Cytidine, Deoxycytidine, and Their Analog Monophosphates by Human UMP/CMP Kinase Is Differentially Regulated by ATP and Magnesium.	Human UMP/CMP kinase (cytidylate kinase; EC 2.7.4.14) is responsible for phosphorylation of CMP, UMP, and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) and also plays an important role in the activation of pyrimidine analogs, some of which are clinically useful anticancer or antiviral drugs. Previous kinetic data using recombinant or highly purified human UMP/CMP kinase showed that dCMP, as well as pyrimidine analog monophosphates, were much poorer substrates than CMP or UMP for this enzyme. This implies that other unidentified mechanisms must be involved to make phosphorylation of dCMP or pyrimidine analog monophosphates inside cells by this enzyme possible. Here, we reevaluated the optimal reaction conditions for human recombinant human UMP/CMP kinase to phosphorylate dCMP and CMP (referred as dCMPK and CMPK activities). We found that ATP and magnesium were important regulators of the kinase activities of this enzyme. Free magnesium enhanced dCMPK activity but inhibited CMPK activity. Free ATP or excess ATP/magnesium, on the other hand, inhibited dCMPK but not CMPK reactions. The differential regulation of dCMPK versus CMPK activities by ATP or magnesium was also seen in other 2'-deoxypyrimidine analog monophosphates (deoxyuridine monophosphate, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine monophosphate, and gemcitabine monophosphate) versus their ribose-counterparts (UMP and 5-fluorouridine monophosphate), in a similar manner. The data suggest that the active sites of human UMP/CMP kinase for dCMP and for CMP cannot be identical. Furthermore, enzyme inhibition studies demonstrated that CMP could inhibit dCMP phosphorylation in a noncompetitive manner, with Ki values much higher than its own Km values. We thus propose novel models for the phosphorylation action of human UMP/CMP kinase.
15554912	Differences in the determinants of eplerenone, spironolactone and aldosterone binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor.	The importance of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists in the treatment of cardiovascular disease has been emphasised by two recent clinical trials, one using spironolactone and the other using a new selective MR antagonist, namely eplerenone. Eplerenone has a very low affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Determinants of binding specificity of eplerenone to the MR were investigated using chimeras created between the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of the MR and the GR. These chimeras had been used previously to investigate aldosterone and spironolactone binding specificity to the MR. Eplerenone competed strongly for [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a MR/GR chimera containing amino acids 804-874 of the MR and weakly to a chimera containing amino acids 672-803 of the MR. Within the 804-874 region, eplerenone competed for [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera containing amino acids 820-844 of the MR, although the calculated affinity was approximately 10-fold lower than for binding to the full-length MR LBD. Similar results were obtained using another MR antagonist, namely spironolactone. Modelling of eplerenone binding to the MR LBD, based on the GR LBD crystal structure, suggests that amino acids 820-844 affect the overall shape of the ligand-binding pocket and that eplerenone acts as an MR antagonist because it fails to stabilize the active conformation of the receptor. In contrast with results with the MR antagonists eplerenone and spironolactone, amino acids 820-844 are sufficient in themselves to confer high-affinity aldosterone binding to the MR, suggesting that the binding determinants of the two antagonists are similar to each other but differ from those of aldosterone.
15561838	Functional cloning of Bacillus anthracis dihydrofolate reductase and confirmation of natural resistance to trimethoprim.	Bacillus anthracis is reported to be naturally resistant to trimethoprim (TMP), a drug that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in the folate pathway. A microdilution broth assay established that the MIC of TMP for B. anthracis Sterne is >2,048 but < or =4,096 microg/ml. A putative DHFR sequence was amplified from B. anthracis Sterne genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into the Invitrogen pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector, followed by transformation into Escherichia coli TOP10F' chemically competent cells. Plasmid DNA from a clone showing the correct construct with a thrombin cleavage site attached downstream from the terminus of the cloned PCR product was transformed into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells for expression of the six-histidine-tagged fusion protein and purification on a His-Bind resin column. Functionality of the purified Sterne recombinant DHFR (Sterne rDHFR) was confirmed in an established enzyme assay. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of TMP and methotrexate for the Sterne rDHFR were found to be 77,233 and 12.2 nM, respectively. TMP resistance was observed with E. coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells transformed with the Sterne DHFR gene. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Sterne DHFR gene revealed 100% homology with various virulent strains of B. anthracis. These results confirm the natural resistance of B. anthracis to TMP and clarify that the resistance is correlated to a lack of selectivity for the chromosomally encoded gene product. These findings will assist in the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents for treatment of anthrax.
15562618	Inhibition of Leishmania donovani promastigote DNA topoisomerase I and human monocyte DNA topoisomerases I and II by antimonial drugs and classical antitopoisomerase agents.	We have compared the inhibitor sensitivities of DNA topoisomerase I (TOPI) from Leishmania donovani promastigotes and TOPs I and II of human monocytes using pentavalent and trivalent antimonials (SbV, SbIII) and classical TOP inhibitors. Bis-benzimidazoles (Hoechst-33258 and -33342) were potent inhibitors of both parasite and human TOPI, but Hoechst-33342 was markedly less cytotoxic to promastigotes than to monocytes in vitro. Leishmania donovani was also considerably less sensitive than monocytes to camptothecin, both at enzyme and cellular levels. Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) was the only antimonial to inhibit TOPI, exhibiting a significant (P < 0.05) 3-fold greater potency against the L. donovani enzyme but showed low cytotoxicities against intact promastigotes. The SbV meglumine antimoniate failed to inhibit TOPI and showed negligible cytotoxicities, whereas SbIII drugs were lethal to parasites and monocytes yet poor inhibitors of TOPI. Monocyte TOPII was inhibited by bis-benzimidazoles and insensitive to antimonials and camptothecin. The disparity between the high leishmanicidal activity and low anti-TOPI potency of SbIII indicates that in vivo targeting of L. donovani TOPI by the reductive pathway of antimonial activation is improbable. Nevertheless, the potent direct inhibition of TOPI by SSG and the differential interactions of camptothecin with L. donovani and human TOPI support the possibility of developing parasite-specific derivatives.
15563582	Structural determinants of arylacetic acid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs necessary for binding and activation of the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2.	The chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates chemotaxis of inflammatory cells in response to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), is hypothesized to play a role in Th2-mediated allergic disease. In addition to PGD2, CRTH2 can be activated by indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor and widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). To evaluate the structural features that confer CRTH2 binding selectivity, structure-activity relationship analysis of arylacetic acid class NSAIDs as CRTH2 receptor ligands was performed. Indomethacin, sulindac sulfide, and zomepirac displaced [3H]PGD2 binding at the mouse CRTH2 receptor (mCRTH2) with comparable affinity (Ki = 1.5 +/- 0.1, 2.5 +/- 0.4, and 3.3 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively). The indomethacin metabolite 5'-O-desmethyl indomethacin (5'-DMI) possessed binding affinity similar to indomethacin; however, elimination of the 2-methyl substituent on the indole ring resulted in a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity. No binding was detected for indole acetic acid and indole derivatives such as tryptophan, serotonin, and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid, demonstrating the importance of the N-acyl moiety of indomethacin. Neutral derivatives of indomethacin also failed to bind to mCRTH2, suggesting that the negatively charged carboxylate moiety participates in a key ligand-receptor interaction. Despite similar binding affinities, NSAID-type mCRTH2 ligands exhibited variable potencies as mCRTH2 agonists. Sulindac sulfide and 5'-DMI inhibited intracellular cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) generation and stimulated cell migration comparable with indomethacin. In contrast, zomepirac did not inhibit [cAMP]i generation or stimulate cell migration but weakly antagonized the effects of indomethacin on [cAMP]i. Together, these results reveal structural features of arylacetic acid NSAIDs that may be exploited for the development of selective CRTH2 ligands.
15571283	Intracellular thymidylate synthase inhibition by trifluorothymidine in FM3A cells.	Trifluorothymidine (TFT) can be phosphorylated by thymidine kinase (TK) to TFTMP which can inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in depletion of thymidine nucleotides. TFT can be degraded by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) which can be inhibited by thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI). Using the TS in situ Inhibition Assay (TSIA) FM3A breast cancer cells were exposed 4 h or 24 h to TFT and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU). TS activity reduced to 9% (0.1 microM TFT) and 58% (1 microM 5FU) after 4 h exposure and to 6% (TFT) and 21% (5FU) after 24 h exposure. TPI did not affect TS inhibition by TFT. FM3A cells lacking TK or TS activity (FM3A/TK-) were far less sensitive to TFT compared to FM3A cells.

15574747	Acid-induced pain and its modulation in humans.	Despite the discovery of ion channels that are activated by protons, we still know relatively little about the signaling of acid pain. We used a novel technique, iontophoresis of protons, to investigate acid-induced pain in human volunteers. We found that transdermal iontophoresis of protons consistently caused moderate pain that was dose-dependent. A marked desensitization occurred with persistent stimulation, with a time constant of approximately 3 min. Recovery from desensitization occurred slowly, over many hours. Acid-induced pain was significantly augmented in skin sensitized by acute topical application of capsaicin. However, skin desensitized by repeated capsaicin application showed no significant reduction in acid-induced pain, suggesting that both capsaicin-sensitive and insensitive sensory neurons contribute to acid pain. Furthermore, topical application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) significantly attenuated acid-evoked pain but did not affect the heat pain threshold, suggesting a specific interaction between NSAIDs and peripheral acid sensors. Subcutaneous injection of amiloride (1 mm) also significantly inhibited the pain induced by iontophoresis of acid, suggesting an involvement of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) receptors. Conversely, iontophoresis of acid over a wide range of skin temperatures from 4 to 40 degrees C produced only minor changes in the induced pain. Together these data suggest a prominent role for ASIC channels and only a minor role for transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 as mediators of cutaneous acid-induced pain.
15579329	Intracellular Ca2+ stimulates the binding to androgen receptors in platelets.	In this study, we demonstrated that ADP-induced platelet aggregation activates the binding of testosterone (T) to its receptor. It is well known that binding of ADP to its receptors induced the release of Ca2+ ions from dense bodies into the cytosol of platelets. In this work, we compared the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone to their receptors using cytosol obtained from ADP-treated and non-treated platelets. These experiments were repeated using EGTA (a calcium chelator) or U73122 (a phospholipase C enzymatic activity inhibitor) to the ADP-treated platelets. In addition, we also developed a competition analysis for the androgen receptors (AR) using [3H]DHT, non-radioactive T, DHT or cyproterone acetate from ADP-treated platelets cytosol. The results from this study indicate that the cytosol obtained from non-ADP-treated platelets did not show any binding to [3H]T or [3H]DHT, whereas cytosol from ADP-treated platelets binds to the radio-labeled androgens. Furthermore cytosol from ADP plus U73122-treated platelets did not show binding to [3H]T or [3H]DHT. These data suggest that intracellular Ca2+ ions stimulates the binding of androgens to their receptors in platelets cytosol. The competition analysis shows that T and DHT have high affinities for the androgen receptors with similar IC50 values, whereas cyproterone acetate shows a lower affinity. The results from these data clearly indicate the presence of androgen receptors in platelets.
15579516	Pharmacologic demonstration of the synergistic effects of a combination of the renin inhibitor aliskiren and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan on the angiotensin II-renin feedback interruption.	Interrupting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with a usual daily dose of a single-site RAS inhibitor does not achieve complete and long-lasting pharmacologic blockade. Hormonal and BP effects were compared for 48 h after administration of single oral doses of 300 mg (high dose) of the renin inhibitor aliskiren (A300) and 160 mg (standard antihypertensive dose) of the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan (V160) and their combination each at half dose (A150+V80) in 12 mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four-period crossover study, A300 decreased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I and II levels for 48 h, stimulated immunoreactive active renin release more strongly than V160, and decreased urinary aldosterone excretion for a longer duration than V160. In contrast to V160, the A150+V80 combination did not increase plasma angiotensins. The renin and aldosterone effects of the A150+V80 combination were similar to those of A300 and greater than those of V160. When plasma drug concentrations were taken into account, the A150 +V80 combination had a synergistic effect on renin release. The A150+V80 combination lowered BP at least as effectively as either higher dose monotherapy. In conclusion, in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals, the long-lasting effects of aliskiren alone or in combination with valsartan on plasma immunoreactive active renin and urinary aldosterone effects demonstrate strong and prolonged blockade of angiotensin II at the kidney and the adrenal level. Moreover, a renin inhibitor and AT1R antagonist combination may provide synergistic effects on RAS hormone levels.
15580557	Variations in human HM74 (GPR109B) and HM74A (GPR109A) niacin receptors.	HM74 (GPR109B) and the highly homologous gene, HM74A (GPR109A) code for Gi-G protein-coupled orphan receptors that recently have been discovered to be involved in the metabolic effects of niacin. The B vitamin niacin is an important agent used in the treatment of dyslipidemias, but its use is limited by side effects. The novel role of the adjacent HM74 and HM74A genes in the metabolism of niacin may provide new targets for drug development. Human genetic variations in HM74 and HM74A have been reported but have not been studied in detail. These variations may play a role in the response to agents targeting receptors coded by these genes. Here we show that many of the nonsynonymous SNPs listed in public databases for HM74 and HM74A are artifacts resulting from extensive homology between these two genes. This may be representative of a neglected phenomenon in reporting sequences of highly homologous genes. We provide primer sequences that permit selective amplification of the complete coding regions of HM74 and HM74A. Using these primers, we show that subsequent sequencing of HM74 and HM74A reveals a novel and unique variation in the HM74A gene. Haplotype analysis suggests four SNPs can define the five major haplotypes that lie within a single haplotype block encompassing these two genes.
15598423	Immunomodulatory drugs inhibit expression of cyclooxygenase-2 from TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and LPS-stimulated human PBMC in a partially IL-10-dependent manner.	Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are potent inhibitors of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and elevators of IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated human PBMC. They are currently in clinical trials for various diseases, including multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and melanoma. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of thalidomide, CC-5013 and CC-4047 on the expression of COX-2 by stimulated PBMC. Our results show that thalidomide and IMiDs inhibited the expression of COX-2 but not the COX-1 protein in LPS-TNF-alpha and IL-1beta stimulated PBMC and shortened the half-life of COX-2 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. They also inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 from LPS-stimulated PBMC. While anti-TNF-alpha or IL-1beta neutralizing antibodies had no effect on COX-2 expression, anti-IL-10 neutralizing antibody elevated the expression of COX-2 mRNA, and protein from treated PBMC. These data suggest that the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects of IMiDs may be due in part to elevation of IL-10 production and its subsequent inhibition of COX-2 expression.
15606893	Characterization of an allosteric citalopram-binding site at the serotonin transporter.	The serotonin transporter (SERT), which belongs to a family of sodium/chloride-dependent transporters, is the major pharmacological target in the treatment of several clinical disorders, including depression and anxiety. In the present study we show that the dissociation rate, of [3H]S-citalopram from human SERT, is retarded by the presence of serotonin, as well as by several antidepressants, when present in the dissociation buffer. Dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram from SERT is most potently inhibited by S-citalopram followed by R-citalopram, sertraline, serotonin and paroxetine. EC50 values for S- and R-citalopram are 3.6 +/- 0.4 microm and 19.4 +/- 2.3 microm, respectively. Fluoxetine, venlafaxine and duloxetine have no significant effect on the dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram. Allosteric modulation of dissociation is independent of temperature, or the presence of Na+ in the dissociation buffer. Dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram from a complex with the SERT double-mutant, N208Q/N217Q, which has been suggested to be unable to self-assemble into oligomeric complexes, is retarded to an extent similar to that found with the wild-type, raising the possibility that the allosteric mechanism is mediated within a single subunit. A species-scanning mutagenesis study comparing human and bovine SERT revealed that Met180, Tyr495 and Ser513 are important residues in mediating the allosteric effect, as well as contributing to high-affinity binding at the primary site.
15618715	Potential cholestatic activity of various therapeutic agents assessed by bile canalicular membrane vesicles isolated from rats and humans.	The active transport of solutes mediated by the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) and multidrug resistance associated protein-2 (MRP2/ABCC2) are thought to involve bile acid-dependent and -independent bile formation, respectively. To evaluate the potential of therapeutic agents as inhibitors of such transporters on bile canalicular membranes, we examined the inhibition of the primary active transport of typical substrates by 15 drugs, clinically known to cause cholestasis in canalicular membrane vesicles. The inhibition by most of the compounds in rat canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) was minimal or observed at much higher concentrations than obtained in clinical situations. However, cloxacillin, cyclosporin A and midecamycin inhibited BSEP, and cyclosporin A and midecamycin inhibited MRP2 with an inhibition constant close to the clinical concentration. By comparing the inhibition potential between rat and human CMVs, the inhibition of BSEP- and MRP2-mediated transport by midecamycin and cyclosporin A was relatively similar whereas the inhibitory effect on BSEP-mediated transport by cloxacillin and glibenclamide was more marked in humans than in rats. These results suggest that the majority of cholestasis-inducing drugs have a minimal inhibitory effect on rat BSEP and MRP2 although species differences in inhibitory potential should be considered, especially in the case of BSEP.
15625110	Biological spectra analysis: Linking biological activity profiles to molecular structure.	Establishing quantitative relationships between molecular structure and broad biological effects has been a longstanding challenge in science. Currently, no method exists for forecasting broad biological activity profiles of medicinal agents even within narrow boundaries of structurally similar molecules. Starting from the premise that biological activity results from the capacity of small organic molecules to modulate the activity of the proteome, we set out to investigate whether descriptor sets could be developed for measuring and quantifying this molecular property. Using a 1,567-compound database, we show that percent inhibition values, determined at single high drug concentration in a battery of in vitro assays representing a cross section of the proteome, provide precise molecular property descriptors that identify the structure of molecules. When broad biological activity of molecules is represented in spectra form, organic molecules can be sorted by quantifying differences between biological spectra. Unlike traditional structure-activity relationship methods, sorting of molecules by using biospectra comparisons does not require knowledge of a molecule's putative drug targets. To illustrate this finding, we selected as starting point the biological activity spectra of clotrimazole and tioconazole because their putative target, lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), was not included in the bioassay array. Spectra similarity obtained through profile similarity measurements and hierarchical clustering provided an unbiased means for establishing quantitative relationships between chemical structures and biological activity spectra. This methodology, which we have termed biological spectra analysis, provides the capability not only of sorting molecules on the basis of biospectra similarity but also of predicting simultaneous interactions of new molecules with multiple proteins.
15644956	Effect of leptin administration versus re-feeding on hypothalamic neuropeptide gene expression in fasted male rats.	Adipocytes are the primary source of circulating leptin. Leptin inhibits eating, increases metabolism, and stimulates the reproductive axis. Numerous hypothalamic neuropeptides have been implicated in leptin's behavioral and neuroendocrine effects, including neuropeptide Y (NPY) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological relevance of leptin's signaling of nutritional status by comparing the effects of leptin with the effects of re-feeding on fasting-induced changes in the expression of the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), NPY, and CART. Adult male rats were fasted for 48 h and treated with either intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) leptin throughout the fast, or fed ad libitum for 24 h after terminating the fast. Expression of NPY, Ob-Rb, and CART mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) was determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry and compared with vehicle-treated fed or fasted controls. Fasting increased NPY and Ob-Rb expression and decreased CART expression in the ARC. Leptin (regardless of route) and re-feeding were equally effective in normalizing CART mRNA expression. A similar trend was observed with Ob-Rb expression. In contrast, neither re-feeding nor s.c. leptin reversed the increased expression of NPY that was induced by fasting. Only i.c.v. leptin was effective in this regard. Our results indicate leptin and re-feeding are equally effective in normalizing fasting-induced changes in CART and Ob-Rb expression, but less effective in normalizing NPY expression. These results suggest that leptin is the primary nutritional signal regulating CART and Ob-Rb expression in the ARC, and highlight potential differences between CART and NPY neuron sensitivity to leptin signaling.
15647998	Haplotype analysis of carnitine transporters and left ventricular mass in human essential hypertension.	The carnitine-associated alteration of myocardial fatty acid metabolism may be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in essential hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that polymorphisms of the genes involved in carnitine transport, OCTN2, CPT1A, CPT1B, and CPT2, might be associated with LVH.
15661821	Impact of glucose infusion on the structural and functional characteristics of adipose tissue and on hypothalamic gene expression for appetite regulatory neuropeptides in the sheep fetus during late gestation.	In the present study, our aim was to determine whether intrafetal glucose infusion increases fetal adiposity, synthesis and secretion of leptin and regulates gene expression of the 'appetite regulatory' neuropeptides neuropepetide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and receptors (leptin receptor (OB-Rb) and melancortin 3 receptor (MC3R)) within the fetal hypothalamus. Glucose (50% dextrose in saline) or saline was infused (7.5 ml h(-1)) into fetal sheep between 130 and 140 days gestation (term = 150 +/- 3 days gestation). Glucose infusion increased circulating glucose and insulin concentrations, mean lipid locule size (532.8 +/- 3.3 microm2 versus 456.7 +/- 14.8 microm2) and total unilocular fat mass (11.7 +/- 0.6 g versus 8.9 +/- 0.6 g) of the perirenal fat depot. The expression of OB-Rb mRNA was higher in the ventromedial nucleus compared to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in both glucose and saline infused fetuses (F= 8.04; P < 0.01) and there was a positive correlation between expression of OB-Rb and MC3R mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (r= 0.81; P < 0.005). Glucose infusion increased mRNA expression for POMC, but not for the anorectic neuropeptide CART, or the orexigenic neuropeptides NPY and AGRP, in the arcuate nucleus of the fetal hypothalamus. These findings demonstrate that increased circulating glucose and insulin regulate gene expression of the neuropeptides within the fetal hypothalamus that are part of the neural network regulating energy balance in adult life.
15668944	Nitric oxide stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells undergo apoptosis induced in part by arachidonic acid derived eicosanoids.	The role of eicosanoids in atherogenesis has not been thoroughly explained. This is partly due to the numerous eicosanoids and the variable effects that each has on different systems. Apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells has been shown to play a role in the atherosclerotic disease leading to lesion formation and further destabilization of the formed lesion. In this study, we have investigated the role of arachidonic acid derived eicosanoids in nitric oxide (NO)-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells. We have shown previously that the nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells was accompanied by arachidonic acid release via cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) activation. Also, arachidonic acid, but not oleic acid, induced apoptosis of these cells at low concentrations (5-10 microM). Our results revealed that the cPLA(2) specific inhibitor, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF(3)), blocked NO-induced eicosanoid production, while the presence of arachidonic acid enhanced the ability of the cells to make prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Also, inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase (Cox) enzymes, such as N-[2-cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (NS-398), a specific Cox-2 inhibitor, or indomethacin, a non-specific Cox inhibitor, blocked NO-induced PGE(2) production and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells to the same extent, indicating that apoptosis might be induced by a Cox-2 metabolic product. In addition to these observations, the eicosanoids investigated, namely, PGE(2), PGI(2) LTB(4), and PGJ(2), showed different effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. Both PGJ(2) and LTB(4) decreased the percentage of viable cells and induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, while PGE(2) and PGI(2) had no effect on cell viability and failed to induce apoptosis. These data suggest that eicosanoids, such as PGJ(2), but not PGE(2) or PGI(2), are involved in NO-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells and that the eicosanoid synthesis pathways might be utilized for vascular therapeutic strategies.
15673722	Alterations in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV in resistant mutants of Clostridium perfringens found after in vitro treatment with fluoroquinolones.	To compare mutations in the DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB) and topoisomerase IV (parC and parE) genes of Clostridium perfringens, which are associated with in vitro exposure to fluoroquinolones, resistant mutants were selected from eight strains by serial passage in the presence of increasing concentrations of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or trovafloxacin. The nucleotide sequences of the entire gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes of 42 mutants were determined. DNA gyrase was the primary target for each fluoroquinolone, and topoisomerase IV was the secondary target. Most mutations appeared in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA (resulting in changes of Asp-87 to Tyr or Gly-81 to Cys) and parC (resulting in changes of Asp-93 or Asp-88 to Tyr or Ser-89 to Ile); only two mutations were found in gyrB, and only two mutations were found in parE. More mutants with multiple gyrA and parC mutations were produced with gatifloxacin than with the other fluoroquinolones tested. Allelic diversity was observed among the resistant mutants, for which the drug MICs increased 2- to 256-fold. Both the structures of the drugs and their concentrations influenced the selection of mutants.
15673729	Mutations in folP associated with elevated sulfonamide MICs for Neisseria meningitidis clinical isolates from five continents.	Sulfonamide resistance in meningococci is associated with mutations in the chromosomal gene folP, which encodes dihydropteroate synthase. Several mutations associated with resistance have been previously described, including amino acid substitutions at codons 31 and 194, a glycine-serine insertion at codons 195 and 196, and, recently, an additional mutation at nucleotide 682 (C682A). In this study, sulfisoxazole MICs were determined for 424 geographically diverse clinical isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, including all major subtypes. A subset of 134 isolates with MICs ranging from 0.5 to >64 microg/ml were assayed for the C682A mutation by real-time PCR, and 25 isolates were selected for folP gene sequencing. All isolates for which the sulfisoxazole MIC was >/=8 possessed the C682A mutation by real-time PCR or folP sequencing, and 34 of 35 isolates with a MIC of </=2 lacked this mutation. Of 16 sequenced isolates for which the sulfisoxazole MIC was >/=4, 15 possessed previously described mutations, including 10 at codon 31, 1 at codon 194, and 4 with the 2-amino-acid insertion codons 195 and 196; all 16 possessed the C682A mutation. The C682A mutation predicted elevated sulfonamides MICs for a large number of geographically diverse clinical isolates of meningococci. Detection of this mutation by real-time PCR or other methods may allow more wide-scale detection of meningococcal isolates with for which the sulfonamide MICs are elevated without resorting to multiple assays or folP gene sequencing, providing a simple, high-throughput screening method for use in public health and epidemiologic settings.
15674236	Minocycline protects against permanent cerebral ischemia in wild type but not in matrix metalloprotease-9-deficient mice.	Minocycline is protective in models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We studied whether minocycline and doxycycline, another tetracycline derivative, provide protection in permanent MCAO. Because minocycline inhibits matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), we also compared minocycline's protective effect in wild type (wt) and MMP-9 knock-out (ko) mice. Wt FVB/N, Balb/C, and two lines of MMP-9 ko and their wt C57Bl/6 control mice were subjected to 24- or 72-hour permanent MCAO. Drug administration was started either 12 hours before or 2 hours after the onset of MCAO. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining or T2-weighted MRI. Zymography was used to study the expression of MMPs. In wt strains, tetracycline treatments started before MCAO reduced the infarct size by 25% to 50%, whereas the treatment started after MCAO was not protective. Minocycline inhibited ischemia-provoked pro-MMP-9 induction in wt mice, but was not protective in MMP-9 ko mice. Pro-MMP-2 was induced by MCAO in wt and MMP-9 ko mice. MCAO-induced pro-MMP-2 was downregulated by minocycline treatment in wt mice but remained in MMP-9 ko mice at the same level as in saline-treated wt mice. Tetracyclines are protective in permanent MCAO when the treatment is started before the insult. Minocycline may provide protection by interfering with MMPs.
15679830	Compound heterozygosity for two non-synonymous polymorphisms in NPC1L1 in a non-responder to ezetimibe.	Ezetimibe reduces plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by blocking sterol absorption in enterocytes. The NPC1L1 gene product was recently identified as the molecular target for ezetimibe, although functional details are incomplete. We used the non-response phenotype of plasma LDL cholesterol to ezetimibe treatment to ascertain individuals who might have variant NPC1L1. We found that one non-responder to ezetimibe was a compound heterozygote for two rare non-synonymous polymorphisms in NPC1L1 that were absent in normal control subjects. We also characterized other NPC1L1 polymorphisms. While there are many explanations for non-response to medications, our data suggest a possible relationship between NPC1L1 variation and ezetimibe response and further indicate that a non-response phenotype might ascertain subjects with genomic DNA variants that could help define metabolic pathways.
15680473	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide potentiates spinal glutamatergic sympathoexcitation in anesthetized rats.	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the rat central nervous system, notably in areas involved in control of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CART peptide fragment 55-102, referred to herein as CARTp, by intrathecal injection on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before and after intrathecal glutamate in urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. CARTp (0.1-10 nmol) administered intrathecally caused no or a small, statistically insignificant increase of blood pressure and heart rate, except at the concentration of 10 nmol, which caused a significant increase of blood pressure and heart rate. Intrathecal glutamate (0.1-10 nmol) produced a dose-dependent increase in arterial pressure and heart rate. Pretreatment with CARTp dose-dependently potentiated the pressor effects of glutamate (1 nmol), which by itself elicited a moderate increase of blood pressure and heart rate. Further, CARTp significantly potentiated the tachycardic effect of glutamate at 1 and 5 nmol, but attenuated the response at 10 nmol. The effect of CARTp was long-lasting, as it enhanced glutamatergic responses up to 90 min after administration. Prior injection of CARTp antiserum (1:500) but not normal rabbit serum nullified the potentiating effect of CARTp on glutamatergic responses. The result suggests that CARTp, whose immunoreactivity is detectable in sympathetic preganglionic neurons as well as in fibers projecting into the intermediolateral cell column, augments spinal sympathetic outflow elicited by glutamate at lower concentrations and may directly excite neurons in the intermediolateral cell column at higher concentrations.
15680478	Leptin fragments induce Fos immunoreactivity in rat hypothalamus.	Leptin presents an important role in energy balance and neuroendocrine control in mammals. In an attempt to identify regions of the leptin molecule responsible for its bioactivity, we have synthesized six peptides based on the protein three-dimensional structure. Fragments were synthesized by the solid-phase methodology, purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS). They were injected intravenously and their ability to induce Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) in rat hypothalamus was compared with that of the recombinant human leptin and saline. Fragment Ac-[Ser117]Lep116-140-NH2 (V) induced Fos-ir in hypothalamic nuclei that express leptin receptor long form. No similar ability was observed for the other five fragments. To investigate whether Fos-ir was induced in the same neuronal group activated by leptin, we proceeded with a dual-label immunohistochemistry for cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), a neuropeptide related to leptin action in rat hypothalamus. We found that Ac-[Ser117]Lep116-140-NH2 (V) differentially activates CART neurons through the rostrocaudal extension of the arcuate nucleus. These results suggest that this fragment acts in the same group of neurons that mediate leptin response. This approach may offer the basis for the development of leptin-related compounds, having potential application in human or veterinary medicine.
15685243	Effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid on Notch signalling in human neuroblastoma cells.	Neuroblastoma (NB), a sympathetically derived childhood tumour, shows characteristics of neuronal precursor cells, suggesting a halted differentiation process. We have previously shown that the Notch signalling cascade, a key player during normal neurogenesis, also might be involved in NB differentiation. Valproic acid (VPA), a well-tolerated antiepileptic drug, has been shown to induce differentiation and cell death of NB cells, possibly associated with its recently described HDAC inhibiting activity. Stimulation of NB cells with VPA led to increased cell death and phenotypic changes associated with differentiation, that is, neurite extension and upregulation of neuronal markers. VPA treatment also led to an activated Notch signalling cascade as shown by increased levels of intracellular Notch-1 and Hes-1, mimicking the initial phase of induced differentiation. These results reinforce that VPA potentially could be used in differentiation therapy of NB and that the effects in part could be a consequence of interference with the Notch signalling cascade.
15689414	beta-Adrenergic-responsive activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases in salivary cells: role of epidermal growth factor receptor and cAMP.	The beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol exerts growth-promoting effects on salivary glands. In this study, activation of ERKs, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, by isoproterenol was examined in a human salivary gland cell line (HSY). Immunoblot analysis indicated that isoproterenol (10(-5) M) induced transient activation of ERK1/2 (4.4-fold relative to basal at 10 min) similar to that caused by EGF (6.7 fold). Isoproterenol, like EGF, also induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. However, inhibition of EGF receptor phosphorylation by the tyrphostin AG-1478 only partially attenuated isoproterenol-induced ERK phosphorylation, whereas EGF-responsive ERK activation was completely blocked. The G(i) inhibitor pertussis toxin also caused partial inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated ERK activation. The cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP) and the cAMP-elevating agents IBMX and cholera toxin produced transient ERK1/2 activation, similar to the effect of isoproterenol, in HSY cells. The stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and cAMP on ERK phosphorylation were not reduced by the PKA inhibitor H-89, whereas the Src family inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidase (PP2) and transfection of a dominant-negative Src construct diminished isoproterenol-induced ERK activation. Isoproterenol induced marked overexpression of the cell growth-related adhesion molecule CD44, and this effect of isoproterenol was abolished by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD-98059. In summary, we show a dual mechanism of isoproterenol-induced ERK phosphorylation in HSY cells-one pathway mediated by EGF receptor transactivation and the other by an EGF receptor-independent pathway possibly mediated by cAMP. Our results also suggest that isoproterenol-induced growth of salivary tissue may involve ERK-mediated CD44 expression.
15694263	Response to chlorpromazine treatment may be associated with polymorphisms of the DRD2 gene in Chinese schizophrenic patients.	Previous studies have demonstrated that the -141C Ins/Del and TaqI A polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene affect the density of the dopamine D2 receptor. The present study examines the correlation between these two polymorphisms and the therapeutic response to chlorpromazine, a typical antipsychotic drug, in 135 inpatients with schizophrenia. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with 300-600 mg/day of chlorpromazine. Our results show that genotyping -141C Ins/Del may help to predict the efficacy of chlorpromazine treatment (P=0.01) due to the fact that patients with no Del allele showed greater improvement than those with Del allele on the overall BPRS (P=0.03), and that, therefore, the potential for therapy in patients with schizophrenia is related to the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism in the DRD2 gene. However, no such relationship was found for the TaqI A polymorphism.
15695064	The S-enantiomer of R,S-citalopram, increases inhibitor binding to the human serotonin transporter by an allosteric mechanism. Comparison with other serotonin transporter inhibitors.	The interaction of the S- and R-enantiomers (escitalopram and R-citalopram) of citalopram, with high- and low-affinity binding sites in COS-1 cell membranes expressing human SERT (hSERT) were investigated. Escitalopram affinity for hSERT and its 5-HT uptake inhibitory potency was in the nanomolar range and approximately 40-fold more potent than R-citalopram. Escitalopram considerably stabilised the [3H]-escitalopram/SERT complex via an allosteric effect at a low-affinity binding site. The stereoselectivity between escitalopram and R-citalopram was approximately 3:1 for the [3H]-escitalopram/hSERT complex. The combined effect of escitalopram and R-citalopram was additive. Paroxetine and sertraline mainly stabilised the [3H]-paroxetine/hSERT complex. Fluoxetine, duloxetine and venlafaxine have only minor effects. 5-HT stabilised the [125I]-RTI-55, [3H]-MADAM, [3H]-paroxetine, [3H]-fluoxetine and [3H]-venlafaxine/SERT complex to some extent. Thus, escitalopram shows a unique interaction with the hSERT compared with other 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and, in addition to its 5-HT reuptake inhibitory properties, displays a pronounced effect via an affinity-modulating allosteric site.
15698514	Inhibition of MCP-1 and MIP-2 chemokines in murine trichinellosis: effect of the anti-inflammatory compound L-mimosine.	Mimosine is a plant amino-acid which has been reported to block DNA replication in mammalian cells and to arrest cell reversibly towards the end of the G1 phase or at the beginning of the S phase. In this study, 42 mice were infected with T. spiralis a nematode parasite, and treated with the anti-inflammatory compound L-mimosine, to determine if any alteration in the chronic inflammatory state occurred, by investigating the hosts immunological response. MCP-1, a C-C chemokine and MIP-2, a C-X-C chemokine were tested and calculated in the sera of infected animals, after 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days post infection, by ELISA method. The diaphragm and the masseters of the infected mice, were tested for inflammatory response. Here we found, that MCP-1 was partially inhibited by L-mimosine, while MIP-2 was totally inhibited. Moreover in sections of the diaphragm and masseters, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes and eosinophils were more intense in untreated animals compared to those treated with L-mimosine. These findings show, that L-mimosine may have an inhibitory effect on MCP-1 and MIP-2 serum levels in Trichinellosis and may influence the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the intensity of the inflammatory reaction in this parasitic disease.
15705795	Endothelial apoptosis induced by inhibition of integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 involves ceramide metabolic pathways.	Matrix ligation of integrins alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 is critical for endothelial survival and angiogenesis. We have previously shown that ceramide, a proapoptotic lipid second messenger, increases during endothelial anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis). We now show that RGDfV, an integrin alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 cyclic function-blocking peptide, increased ceramide and decreased sphingomyelin in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) plated on vitronectin, suggesting that sphingomyelin hydrolysis contributes to RGDfV-induced ceramide increase. Desipramine and imipramine, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), suppressed RGDfV-induced ceramide increase. Importantly, desipramine, imipramine, and a third ASMase inhibitor, SR33557, but not inhibitors of neutral sphingomyelinase, suppressed RGDfV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ASMase was required for integrin-mediated apoptosis. Myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, had no effect on RGDfV-induced HBMEC apoptosis. Interestingly, ASMase inhibitors also suppressed the RGDfV-induced loss of spreading on vitronectin. RGDfV induced a similar increase in ceramide and apoptosis in HBMECs on poly-l-lysine or vitronectin, although cells detached only from vitronectin, indicating that cell detachment was not required for RGDfV-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest involvement of ASMase and ceramide in endothelial apoptosis induced by inhibition of integrins alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5, and propose a novel molecular mechanism for the antiangiogenic effect of RGDfV.
15713990	Higher farnesyl diphosphate synthase activity in human colorectal cancer inhibition of cellular apoptosis.	Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPs) produces FPP which is considered a branch-point intermediate in the synthesis of sterols and isoprenylated cellular metabolites. In this study we investigated whether detectable FPPs activity was present in human colorectal cancer (CRC), also evaluating in vitro the role of this enzyme in the growth and apoptosis of CRC cells by using Pamidronate (PAM), a FPPs activity inhibitor.
15716633	Spreading depression expands traumatic injury in neocortical brain slices.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is particularly common in young people, generating healthcare costs that can span decades. The cellular processes activated in the first minutes following injury are poorly understood, and the 3-4 h following trauma are crucial for reducing subsequent injury. Spreading depression (SD) is a profound inactivation of neurons and glia lasting 1-2 min that arises focally and migrates outward across gray matter. In the hours following focal stroke, the metabolic stress of energy reduction and recurring SD-like events (peri-infarct depolarizations, PIDs) interact to promote neuronal injury. Similar recurring depolarizations might evolve immediately following TBI and exacerbate neuronal damage peripheral to the impact site. To test this possibility and examine if certain drugs might limit damage by inhibiting what we term traumatic spreading depression (tSD), we developed a technique whereby a small weight was dropped onto a live slice of rat neocortex while imaging changes in light transmittance (LT). Imaging revealed a propagating front of increased LT arising at the border of the impact site. Traumatic SD significantly expanded the region of ensuing damage. Both tSD and subsequent damage were blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (100 microM) or the sigma-1 receptor (sigma1R) ligands dextromethorphan (30 microM) or BD-1063 (100 microM). Co-application of the sigma1R antagonist (+)3-PPP with DM reversed the block as did lowering temperature from 35 degrees C to 32 degrees C. This study provides evidence that an event similar to peri-infarct depolarization can arise from an injury site in neocortex within seconds following impact and act to expand the region of acute neuronal damage.
15723541	Kinetic and crystallographic analysis of active site mutants of Escherichia coli gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase.	The E. coli isozyme of gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-AT) is a tetrameric pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes transamination between primary amines and alpha-keto acids. The roles of the active site residues V241, E211, and I50 in the GABA-AT mechanism have been probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The beta-branched side chain of V241 facilitates formation of external aldimine intermediates with primary amine substrates, while E211 provides charge compensation of R398 selectively in the primary amine half-reaction and I50 forms a hydrophobic lid at the top of the substrate binding site. The structures of the I50Q, V241A, and E211S mutants were solved by X-ray crystallography to resolutions of 2.1, 2.5, and 2.52 A, respectively. The structure of GABA-AT is similar in overall fold and active site structure to that of dialkylglycine decarboxylase, which catalyzes both transamination and decarboxylation half-reactions in its normal catalytic cycle. Therefore, an attempt was made to convert GABA-AT into a decarboxylation-dependent aminotransferase similar to dialkylglycine decarboxylase by systematic mutation of E. coli GABA-AT active site residues. Two of the twelve mutants presented, E211S/I50G/C77K and E211S/I50H/V80D, have approximately 10-fold higher decarboxylation activities than the wild-type enzyme, and the E211S/I50H/V80D has formally changed the reaction specificity to that of a decarboxylase.
15730717	[Proliferation inhibition effect of indomethacin on CML cells associated with down-regulation of phosphorylated STAT1/STAT5 and inhibition of COX-2 expression].	To explore the mechanism of anti-proliferative effect of indomethacin (IN) on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells.
15748894	Matrix metalloproteinase inhibition impairs the processing, formation and mineralization of dental tissues during mouse molar development.	Organotypic cultures of embryonic mouse tooth germs were used to investigate the developmental expression and roles of MMPs in the formation and mineralization of dentin and enamel matrices. The spatially and temporally regulated expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-20 in developing mouse tooth germs in vivo was maintained in culture. The inhibition of metalloproteinases activity by marimastat altered the morphogenesis and mineralization of the tooth germs associated with an inhibition of the activation of both MMP-20 and MMP-2. MMP inhibition deregulated the molecular processing of two major dental matrix proteins, amelogenin and dentin sialoprotein (DSP). This coincided with their accumulation and the loss of their normal distribution within the extracellular matrix, resulting in a defective mineralization of dentin and enamel matrices. These findings demonstrate the critical role of MMPs in the processing and maturation of the dental matrix.
15749336	Analysis of SNAP-25 immunoreactivity in hippocampal inhibitory neurons during development in culture and in situ.	Synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is a component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex which plays a central role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We have previously demonstrated that adult rat hippocampal GABAergic synapses, both in culture and in brain, are virtually devoid of SNAP-25 immunoreactivity and are less sensitive to the action of botulinum toxin type A, which cleaves this SNARE protein [Neuron 41 (2004) 599]. In the present study, we extend our findings to the adult mouse hippocampus and we also provide demonstration that hippocampal inhibitory synapses lacking SNAP-25 labeling belong to parvalbumin-, calretinin- and cholecystokinin-positive interneurons. A partial colocalization between SNAP-25 and glutamic acid decarboxylase is instead detectable in developing mouse hippocampus at P0 and, at a lesser extent, at P5. In rat embryonic hippocampal cultures at early developmental stages, SNAP-25 immunoreactivity is detectable in a percentage of GABAergic neurons, which progressively reduces with time in culture. Consistent with the presence of the substrate, botulinum toxin type A is partially effective in inhibiting synaptic vesicle recycling in immature GABAergic neurons. Since SNAP-25, beside its role as a SNARE protein, is involved in additional processes, such as neurite outgrowth and regulation of calcium dynamics, the presence of higher levels of the protein at specific stages of neuronal differentiation may have implications for the construction and for the functional properties of brain circuits.
15753388	Imatinib mesylate inhibits Leydig cell tumor growth: evidence for in vitro and in vivo activity.	Leydig cell tumors are usually benign tumors of the male gonad. However, if the tumor is malignant, no effective treatments are currently available. Leydig cell tumors express platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), kit ligand and their respective receptors, PDGFR and c-kit. We therefore evaluated the effects of imatinib mesylate (imatinib), a selective inhibitor of the c-kit and PDGFR tyrosine kinases, on the growth of rodent Leydig tumor cell lines in vivo and in vitro, and examined, in human Leydig cell tumor samples, the expression of activated PDGFR and c-kit and the mutations in exons of the c-kit gene commonly associated with solid tumors. Imatinib caused concentration-dependent decreases in the viability of Leydig tumor cell lines, which coincided with apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of c-kit and PDGFRs. Mice bearing s.c. allografts of a Leydig tumor cell line treated with imatinib p.o., had an almost complete inhibition of tumor growth, less tumor cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and a lesser amount of tumor-associated mean vessel density compared with controls. No drug-resistant tumors appeared during imatinib treatment but tumors regrew after drug withdrawal. Human Leydig cell tumors showed an intense expression of the phosphorylated form of c-kit and a less intense expression of phosphorylated PDGFRs. No activating mutations in common regions of mutation of the c-kit gene were found. Our studies suggest that Leydig cell tumors might be a potential target for imatinib therapy.
15756931	Tenoxicam exerts a neuroprotective action after cerebral ischemia in rats.	In this study we investigated the effects of Tenoxicam, a type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitor, on brain damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion. Male Wistar rats (18-month old average) were anesthetized and submitted to ischemia occlusion of both common carotid arteries (BCAO) for 45 min. After 24 h of reperfusion, rats were decapitated and hippocampi removed for further assays. Animals were divided into sham-operated, ischemia, ischemia + Tenoxicam 2.5 mg/kg, and ischemia + Tenoxicam 10 mg/kg groups. Tenoxicam was administered intraperitoneally immediately after BCAO. Histological analyses show that ischemia produced significant striatal as well as hippocampal lesions which were reversed by the Tenoxicam treatment. Tenoxicam also significantly reduced, to control levels, the increased myeloperoxidase activity in hippocampus homogenates observed after ischemia. However, nitrite concentrations showed only a tendency to decrease in the ischemia + Tenoxicam groups, as compared to that of ischemia alone. On the other hand, hippocampal glutamate and aspartate levels were not altered by Tenoxicam. In conclusion, we showed that ischemia is certainly related to inflammation and to increased free radical production, and selective COX-2 inhibitors might be neuroprotective agents of potential benefit in the treatment of cerebral brain ischemia.
15758172	Acid-sensing properties in rat gastric sensory neurons from normal and ulcerated stomach.	Gastric acid contributes to dyspeptic symptoms, including abdominal pain, in patients with disorders of the proximal gastrointestinal tract. To examine the molecular sensor(s) of gastric acid chemonociception, we characterized acid-elicited currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and nodose ganglion (NG) neurons that innervate the stomach and examined their modulation after induction of gastric ulcers. A fluorescent dye (DiI) was injected into the stomach wall to retrogradely label gastric sensory neurons. After 1-2 weeks, gastric ulcers were induced by 45 s of luminal exposure of the stomach to 60% acetic acid injected into a clamped area of the distal stomach; control animals received saline. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, all gastric DRG neurons and 55% of NG neurons exhibited transient, amiloride-sensitive, acid-sensing ion-channel (ASIC) currents. In the remaining 45% of NG neurons, protons activated a slow, sustained current that was attenuated by the transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 antagonist, capsazepine. The kinetics and proton sensitivity of amiloride-sensitive ASIC currents differed between NG and DRG neurons. NG neurons had a lower proton sensitivity and faster kinetics, suggesting expression of specific subtypes of ASICs in the vagal and splanchnic innervation of the stomach. Effects of Zn2+ and N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine on acid-elicited currents suggest contributions of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits. Gastric ulcers altered the properties of acid-elicited currents by increasing pH sensitivity and current density and changing current kinetics in gastric DRG neurons. The distinct properties of NG and DRG neurons and their modulation after injury suggest differential contributions of vagal and spinal afferent neurons to chemosensation and chemonociception.
15770365	Suppression of experimental aortic aneurysms: comparison of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors.	The rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with inflammation, destruction of extracellular matrix, and production of both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, may prevent AAA formation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. We hypothesized that indomethacin, rofecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor), and 1400 W (selective iNOS activity inhibitor) would decrease aneurysm formation in the rat model. Forty-six male Wistar rats underwent intraaortic elastase infusion in two parallel studies based on medication delivery route. Sixteen rats were randomized to rofecoxib or water by gastric lavage. Thirty rats were randomized to subcutaneous saline, indomethacin, or 1400 W. Heart rate, blood pressure and aortic diameters were measured. Western Blot and mRNA analysis for MMP-9 and iNOS was performed on postoperative day 7 aortic segments. Elastin degradation and inflammation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Elastase infusion produced AAA in all rats. 1400 W significantly limited aneurysm expansion (p = 0.01) whereas treatment with indomethacin and rofecoxib did not. Only 1400 W significantly increased blood pressure (p < 0.001). Indomethacin alone statistically decreased MMP-9 (p < 0.011). 1400 W resulted in greater conservation of aortic elastin than indomethacin (p = 0.025). All groups demonstrated statistically similar expression of iNOS. In conclusion, selective iNOS activity inhibitor, 1400 W, significantly decreased aneurysm size and preserved aortic elastin without altering MMP-9 levels. Indomethacin significantly decreased MMP-9 expression without decreasing aneurysm size. Rofecoxib did not significantly decrease MMP-9 expression or aneurysm size. Inhibition of iNOS limits aneurysmal expansion by mechanisms other than MMP-9 inhibition. MMP-9 inhibition by indomethacin is not sufficient to limit aneurysm expansion in our model.
15771438	Comparison of sulfamate and sulfamide groups for the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase-II by using topiramate as a structural platform.	This paper examines the relative effectiveness of sulfamate and sulfamide groups for the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II). Topiramate (1) and its sulfamide analogue 4, and 4,5-cyclic sulfate 6 and its sulfamide analogue 5, were compared for inhibition of human CA-II. A colorimetric assay, based on the pH shift that accompanies hydration of carbon dioxide, and an esterase assay were used. For these bioisosteric pairs, 1/4 and 6/5, the sulfamate compound was markedly more potent than its sulfamide counterpart. A similar, large difference in potency was also observed for the sulfamate/sulfamide pairs 14/15 and 16/17. These results indicate that the sulfamide moiety is not particularly suitable for obtaining potent carbonic anhydrase inhibition. A discussion of this structure-activity relationship with respect to the interactions of 1 and 6 with CA-II from published X-ray data is presented. A metabolic acidosis study was performed in rats with 1, 4, 6, and 2, and the results are discussed with respect to the degree of inhibition of CA-II in vivo.
15778128	Effect of a fermented ginseng extract, BST204, on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in murine macrophages.	This paper investigates how BST204, a fermented ginseng extract, affects the expression and mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). BST204 was prepared by incubating crude ginseng extract with ginsenoside-beta-glucosidase. Unexpectedly, BST204 had no effect on the level of COX-2 protein in unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, and it suppressed the level of COX-2 protein and PGE(2) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. It did not show any suppressive effect, though, on the COX-2 mRNA level. To investigate the suppressive mechanism of COX-2 protein, the activating phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, which are important for translation, were measured. The phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, not 4E-BP1, was increased by LPS in a time-dependent manner, and was inhibited by BST204 in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of COX-2 protein, however, was partially suppressed by rapamycin, an upstream inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase. Therefore, this paper suggests that the suppression of COX-2 protein by BST204 was partially correlated with the inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activation.
15778703	Blockade of HERG cardiac K+ current by antifungal drug miconazole.	1. Miconazole, an imidazole antifungal agent, is associated with acquired long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. Miconazole increases the plasma concentration of QT-prolonging drugs by inhibiting the hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway, but whether it has direct effects on cardiac ion channels has not been elucidated. 2. To determine the mechanism underlying these clinical findings, we investigated the effect of miconazole on human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ channels. 3. HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and whole-cell currents were recorded using a patch-clamp technique (23 degrees C). 4. Miconazole inhibited HERG peak tail current in a concentration-dependent manner (0.4-40 microM) with an IC50 of 2.1 microM (n=3-5 cells at each concentration, Hill coefficient 1.2). HERG block was not frequency-dependent. It required channel activation, occurred rapidly, and had very slow dissociation properties. 5. The activation curve was shifted in a negative direction (V(1/2): -9.5+/-2.3 mV in controls and -15.3+/-2.4 mV after 4 microM miconazole, P<0.05, n=6). Miconazole did not change other channel kinetics (activation, deactivation, onset of inactivation, recovery from inactivation, steady-state inactivation). 6. The S6 domain mutation, F656C, abolished the inhibitory action of miconazole on HERG current indicating that miconazole preferentially binds to an aromatic amino-acid residue within the pore-S6 region. 7. Our findings indicate that miconazole causes HERG channel block by binding to a common drug receptor, and this involves preferential binding to activated channels. Thus, miconazole prolongs the QT interval by direct inhibition of HERG channels.
15781964	Bromocriptine and clozapine regulate dopamine 2 receptor gene expression in the mouse striatum.	In a previous study, we showed that the psychoactive drug caffeine alters the expression of the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) gene in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that acute administration of antipsychotic and anti-parkinsonian drugs also regulate D2R gene expression in PC12 cells and in the mouse striatum. Treatment of PC12 cells with the atypical antipsychotic and specific 5-HT antagonist clozapine (60 microM) reduced D2R/luciferase reporter expression by 46% after 24 h. However, male and female mice treated with a clinical dose of clozapine (10 mg/kg) showed no changes in striatal D2R mRNA expression when assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. Treatment of PC12 cells with the specific D2R agonist anti-parkinsonian drug, bromocriptine mesylate (BCM; 5 microM) also resulted in decreased D2R/luciferase reporter activity (27%). In contrast to clozapine, a clinical dose of BCM (16 mg/kg) led to a 21% decrease and a 45% increase in striatal D2R mRNA expression in male and female mice, respectively, after 24 h. Coadministration of clozapine and BCM in PC12 cells resulted in a synergistic decrease in D2R/luciferase reporter expression (68%), and coadministration of these drugs in vivo led to decreases in striatal D2R mRNA expression in both male and female mice (45% and 22%, respectively). Collectively, these results indicate that clozapine, BCM, or a combination of these drugs have differential effects on dopamine receptor gene expression and might also affect striatal physiology in a sexually dimorphic manner.
15790782	Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) genotypes as determinants of acenocoumarol sensitivity.	The aim of the study is to explore the contribution of genetic factors related either to drug metabolism (cytochrome P450 2C9) or to drug target (vitamin K epoxide reductase) to variability in the response to acenocoumarol among 222 healthy volunteers after a single oral dose. Associations between a pharmacodynamic index (reduction in factor VII activity and international normalized ratio [INR] change) and several genetic polymorphisms (VKORC1: -4931T>C, -4451C>A, -2659G>C, -1877A>G, -1639G>A, 497C>G, 1173C>T, and CYP2C9*3) were investigated using haplotype and univariate analyses. VKORC1 haplotypes were associated with the pharmacologic response, and this association can be explained only by the effect of the -1639G>A polymorphism (or alternatively by 1173C>T, which is in complete association with it). Indeed, it explains about one third of the variability of the pharmacologic response (37% of factor VII decrease and 30% of INR change). Moreover, the previously observed effect of the CYP2C9*3 allele is independent of the VKORC1 gene effect. These 2 polymorphisms account for up to 50% of the interindividual variability. The simple genotyping of 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), VKORC1 -1639G>A or 1173C>T and the CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms, could thus predict a high risk of overdose before initiation of anticoagulation with acenocoumarol, and provide a safer and more individualized anticoagulant therapy.
15803362	A phase II trial of imatinib mesylate monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.	Imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of Abl, KIT, and PDGFR tyrosine kinases. Breast cancer has variable expression of KIT and PDGFR therefore we conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of imatinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
15814090	Differential effects of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) blocking agents on QT duration variability in conscious dogs.	The effects of drugs that inhibit human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) related cardiac potassium channels on the variability of QT duration as a sign of repolarisation instability were evaluated in conscious telemetered dogs. QT duration variability was determined using a beat-to-beat analysis before and after the infusions of HERG channel blocking agents. Variability was evaluated as increased mean width (P(width)) and length (P(length)) of Poincaré plots of 100 consecutive beats. As HERG channel blockers which are associated with arrhythmias of the torsades de pointes (TdP) type, dofetilide and sotalol were infused. Verapamil was used as an HERG channel blocker that is not associated with TdP. Dofetilide (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) dose-dependently prolonged QT(c) duration (12% and 16%). Dofetilide also induced an increase of QT variability that reached statistical significance for P(length) at the higher dose (64%). A dose of 3 mg/kg sotalol neither prolonged QT(c) duration nor QT duration variability. In contrast, at 10 mg/kg sotalol prolonged QT(c) duration (15%) and increased P(length) (33%). Doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg verapamil did not increase QT(c) duration nor QT time variability. QT duration variability in conscious dogs may be a useful preclinical marker to discriminate pro-arrhythmogenic and non-arrhythmogenic activities of HERG blocking agents.
15814154	Norepinephrine transporter function and desipramine: residual drug effects versus short-term regulation.	Previous research has shown that exposure of norepinephrine transporter (NET)-expressing cells to desipramine (DMI) downregulates the norepinephrine transporter, although changes in the several transporter parameters do not demonstrate the same time course. Exposures to desipramine for <1 day reduces only radioligand binding and uptake capacity while transporter-immunoreactivity is unaffected. Recent demonstration of persistent drug retention in cells following desipramine exposures raises the possibility that previous reported changes in the norepinephrine transporter may be partly accountable by residual drug. In this study, potential effects of residual desipramine on norepinephrine transporter binding and uptake were re-evaluated following exposures of PC12 cells to desipramine using different methods to remove residual drug. Using a method that minimizes residual drug, exposure of intact PC12 cells to desipramine for 4h had no effect on uptake capacity or [(3)H]nisoxetine binding to the norepinephrine transporter, while exposures for > or =16 h reduced uptake capacity. Desipramine-induced reductions in binding to the transporter required >24 h or greater periods of desipramine exposure. This study confirms that uptake capacity of the norepinephrine transporter is reduced earlier than changes in radioligand binding, but with a different time course than originally shown. Special pre-incubation procedures are required to abolish effects of residual transporter inhibitor when studying inhibitor-induced transporter regulation.
15831440	Rofecoxib produces intestinal but not gastric damage in the presence of a low dose of indomethacin in rats.	Indomethacin in small doses is known to inhibit prostaglandin (PG) production, yet it does not damage the gastrointestinal mucosa. We examined whether a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor induces gastrointestinal damage in the presence of a low dose of indomethacin and investigated the ulcerogenic mechanism in relation to COX-2 expression. Rats with or without 18-h fasting were administered rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor; 10 or 30 mg/kg p.o.) in the absence or presence of indomethacin (3 mg/kg p.o.), and the gastric or intestinal mucosa was examined 8 and 24 h later, respectively. Neither indomethacin nor rofecoxib alone caused damage in the stomach or small intestine. However, indomethacin damaged the small intestine in the presence of rofecoxib, yet the same treatment did not damage the stomach. Indomethacin reduced the mucosal PGE2 content in both tissues, whereas rofecoxib did not. The COX-2 mRNA was up-regulated in the intestine but not the stomach after indomethacin treatment, and the reduced PGE2 content was significantly recovered later only in the small intestine, in a rofecoxib-inhibitable manner. Indomethacin produced hypermotility in the small intestine but not the stomach, whereas rofecoxib had no effect. These results suggest that the PG deficiency caused by a low dose of indomethacin produces hypermotility and COX-2 expression in the small intestine but not the stomach, resulting in damage when COX-2 is inhibited. It is assumed that the hypermotility response is a key event in the expression of COX-2 and thereby important in the development of mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract.
15840408	Differential effect of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on lipopolysaccharide-induced adhesion molecule expression on human monocytes.	The effect of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on the 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, B7.1, B7.2, CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on monocytes was examined. Prostaglandin E1 suppressed B7.1 and CD40 expression, but prostaglandin E2 did not effect on any type of adhesion molecule expression. Both prostaglandins inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production and T-cell proliferation of lipopolysaccharide-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Among prostaglandin E1 receptors (IP/EP1/EP2/EP3/EP4) agonists, ONO-1301, a prostanoid IP-receptor agonist, prevented B7.1 and CD40 expression. ONO-AE1-259-01 a prostanoid EP2-receptor agonist, ONO-AE1-329, a prostanoid EP4-receptor agonist, and ONO-1301 inhibited TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation. Moreover, anti-B7.1 and anti-CD40 Abs prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation. Therefore, the effect of prostaglandin E1 on TNF-alpha production and T-cell proliferation might depend on the inhibition of B7.1 and CD40 expression, but that of prostaglandin E2 might be independent of adhesion molecules expression. In conclusion, the mechanism responsible for the effect of prostaglandin E1 on lipopolysaccharide-induced responses is distinct from that of prostaglandin E2.
15850602	Carbamazepine is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases.	Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a common antiepileptic drug (AED) that acts through multiple mechanisms including blockade and potentiation of cation channels and modulation of neurotransmitter levels. Whether it affects any component of the gene transcription machinery is unknown. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important in the regulation of gene expression and are currently considered a potential target for drug development. Using a high-throughput screening assay based on acetylation-dependent gene expression, we identified CBZ as a candidate and proceeded to characterize its effects on HDAC. CBZ induced acetylation of histone H4 in the HepG2 liver carcinoma cell line. CBZ inhibited HDAC 3 and HDAC 7, which are representatives of HDAC class I and II respectively. Quantitative testing in an in vitro assay demonstrated HDAC inhibition with an IC50 of 2 microM. The major active metabolite of CBZ, CBZ-10,11-epoxide, was found to have the same HDAC inhibitory activity. The IC50 is considerably lower than therapeutic plasma levels that are typically achieved in patients (25-51 microM). CBZ shares important clinical characteristics (teratogenicity, activity as a mood stabilizer) with valproic acid, another AED that was recently identified as an inhibitor of HDAC. These observations raise the possibility that HDAC inhibition may contribute to the pharmacological profile of CBZ.
15860753	Glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation in airway cells after inhaled combination therapy.	Clinical evidence is accumulating for the efficacy of adding inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) to corticosteroids in asthma. Corticosteroids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene expression. This article reports the first evidence in vivo of an interaction between inhaled LABA and corticosteroid on GR nuclear translocation in human airway cells using immunocytochemistry. We initially demonstrated significant GR activation 60 minutes after inhalation of 800 microg beclomethasone dipropionate in six healthy subjects. Subsequently, we determined the effects of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (FP) in seven steroid-naive patients with asthma. We observed dose-dependent GR activation with 100- and 500-microg doses of FP, and to a lesser extent with 50 microg salmeterol alone. However, combination therapy with 100 microg FP and salmeterol augmented the action of FP on GR nuclear localization. In vitro, salmeterol enhanced FP effects on GR nuclear translocation in epithelial and macrophage-like airway cell lines. In addition, salmeterol in combination with FP enhanced glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-luciferase reporter gene activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and secretory leuko-proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) gene induction. Together, our data confirm that GR nuclear translocation may underlie the complementary interactions between LABAs and corticosteroids, although the precise signal transduction mechanisms remain to be determined.
15862515	Clozapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole but not haloperidol protect against kainic acid-induced lesion of the striatum in mice, in vivo: role of 5-HT1A receptor activation.	Excessive activation of non-NMDA receptors, AMPA and kainate, contributes to neuronal degeneration in acute and progressive pathologies, possibly including schizophrenia. Because 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists have neuroprotective properties (e.g., against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity), we compared the effects of the antipsychotics, clozapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole, that are partial agonists at 5-HT(1A) receptor, with those of haloperidol, which is devoid of 5-HT(1A) agonist properties, on kainic acid (KA)-induced striatal lesion volumes, in C57Bl/6N mice. The involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors was determined by antagonist studies with WAY100635, and data were compared with those obtained using the potent and high efficacy 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, F13714. Intra-striatal KA lesioning and measurement of lesion volumes using cresyl violet staining were carried out at 48 h after surgery. F13714, antipsychotics or vehicle were administered ip twice, 30 min before and 3 1/2 h after KA injection. WAY100635 (0.63 mg/kg) or vehicle were given sc 30 min before each drug injection. Clozapine (2 x 10 mg/kg), ziprasidone (2 x 20 mg/kg) and aripiprazole (2 x 10 mg/kg) decreased lesion volume by 61%, 59% and 73%, respectively. WAY100635 antagonized the effect of ziprasidone and of aripiprazole but only slightly attenuated that of clozapine. In contrast, haloperidol (2 x 0.16 mg/kg) did not affect KA-induced lesion volume. F13714 dose-dependently decreased lesion volume. The 61% decrease of lesion volume obtained with F13714 (2 x 0.63 mg/kg) was antagonized by WAY100635. WAY100635 alone did not affect lesion volume. These results show that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation protects against KA-induced striatal lesions and indicate that some atypical antipsychotic agents with 5-HT(1A) agonist properties may protect against excitotoxic injury, in vivo.
15864123	Calcium-sensing receptor gene polymorphism Arg990Gly and its possible effect on response to cinacalcet HCl.	Cinacalcet, a novel calcimimetic compound, is effective in reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in approximately 70% of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, interindividual variations in the dose required to achieve the treatment goal have been noted in clinical studies. Our investigation examined the genetic polymorphisms of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene as one possible cause of the different responses to cinacalcet. We report data on seven end-stage renal failure patients who were treated with regular haemodialysis and who participated in clinical trials of cinacalcet. All patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism with baseline intact PTH (iPTH) levels greater than 600 pg/ml. Three patients were male and four female with a mean+/-SD age of 60+/-12 years. DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes. An area in exon 7 of the CaSR gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Mean+/-SD baseline iPTH was 1086+/-189 pg/ml. The five patients without Arg990Gly demonstrated a 29.7+/-4.0% (+/-SEM) reduction in iPTH from individual baseline. One patient was found to be homozygous for the Arg990Gly polymorphism and another was heterozygous for both arginine and glycine alleles. The homozygous patient showed a significantly higher sensitivity to cinacalcet compared to the other patients (P=0.003) with a 76.3+/-7.7% reduction in iPTH from baseline. No polymorphisms were noted in codons 986 or 1011. This preliminary study points to the possibility that patients homozygous for glycine at the 990 position in exon 7 of the CaSR may be more sensitive to the calcimimetic drug cinacalcet compared to those who are homozygous for arginine at that location.
15866114	The effects of chorioamnionitis and betamethasone on 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase types 1 and 2 and the glucocorticoid receptor in preterm human placenta.	Preterm birth is one of the major problems faced in perinatal medicine and is often associated with underlying clinical infection. Treatment with maternal betamethasone has helped to improve neonatal morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that betamethasone treatment and chorioamnionitis would alter the bioavailability of placental glucocorticoids through the regulation of the 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta HSD) isozymes and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).
15869562	Involvement of 5-HT receptors in the regulation of food intake in Siberian hamsters.	The Siberian hamster provides a physiological model for understanding the hypothalamic control of energy metabolism as it undergoes annual photoperiod-regulated cycles of body weight (i.e. fattening in summer, and catabolism of fat stores in winter). As a first step to investigate whether enhanced serotonergic (5-HT) tone might underlie the catabolic processes in short days, we investigated whether serotonergic stimulation can produce catabolic actions in fat hamsters housed in long days. Acute treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (+/-) fenfluramine (8 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a prolonged, dose-dependent reduction in food intake in both photoperiods. Behavioural observations and radiotelemetry analyses revealed that this anorectic effect of fenfluramine was associated with short-term increases in locomotor activity and in core body temperature. In a subsequent series of studies, hamsters were pretreated with the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB242084 (4 mg/kg, i.p.). This 5-HT2C receptor antagonist completely blocked the anorectic actions of fenfluramine, but did not decrease the hyperthermia or hyperlocomotion induced by fenfluramine; thus, the anorectic actions of fenfluramine probably reflect actions via the 5-HT2C receptor. Consistent with these observations, treatment of hamsters with the 5-HT2C receptor agonist VER 3323 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or the 5-HT1B/2C receptor agonist mCPP (3 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced food intake. The response to manipulation of serotonergic pathways was not affected by the ambient photoperiod in any of these studies. We conclude that the anorectic actions of fenfluramine are not an indirect consequence of serotonergic actions on arousal pathways, and that its actions on feeding in the Siberian hamster are most likely to be mediated by the 5-HT2C receptor.
15870086	Antitumoral actions of the anti-obesity drug orlistat (XenicalTM) in breast cancer cells: blockade of cell cycle progression, promotion of apoptotic cell death and PEA3-mediated transcriptional repression of Her2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene.	Orlistat (Xenicaltrade mark), a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for bodyweight loss, has recently been demonstrated to exhibit antitumor properties towards prostate cancer cells by virtue of its ability to block the lipogenic activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS). FAS (oncogenic antigen-519) is up-regulated in about 50% of breast cancers, is an indicator of poor prognosis, and has recently been functionally associated with the Her2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene.
15878511	Synthesis, enantiomeric resolution, F-18 labeling and biodistribution of reboxetine analogs: promising radioligands for imaging the norepinephrine transporter with positron emission tomography.	Racemic and enantiomerically pure ((S,S) and (R,R)) 2-[alpha-(2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)phenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ([(18)F]FRB) and its tetradeuterated form [(18)F]FRB-D(4), analogs of the highly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine (2-[alpha-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine, RB), have been synthesized for studies of norepinephrine transporter (NET) system with positron emission tomography (PET). The [(18)F]fluorinated precursor, (S,S)/(R,R)-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-2-[alpha-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ((S,S)/(R,R)-N-Boc-desethylRB), was prepared by the N-protection of (S,S)/(R,R)-2-[alpha-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ((S,S)/(R,R)-desethylRB) with a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group followed by enantiomeric resolution with chiral HPLC to provide both (S,S) and (R,R) enantiomers with >99% enantiomeric purity. These compounds were then used for radiosynthesis to prepare enantiomerically pure [(18)F]FRB and [(18)F]FRB-D(4) via the following three-step procedure: (1) formation of 1-bromo-2-[(18)F]fluoroethane ([(18)F]BFE or [(18)F]BFE-D(4)) by nucleophilic displacement of 2-bromoethyl triflate (or D(4) analog) with no-carrier added [(18)F]F(-) in THF; (2) reaction of [(18)F]BFE (or [(18)F]BFE-D(4)) with N-Boc-desethylRB in DMF in the presence of excess base; and (3) deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid. The racemates, (S,S) and (R,R) enantiomers of [(18)F]FRB and [(18)F]FRB-D(4) were obtained in 11-27% (decay corrected to the end of bombardment, EOB) in 120-min synthesis time with a radiochemical purity of >98% and specific activities of 21-48 GBq/micromol (EOB). The results of the whole-body biodistribution studies with (S,S)-[(18)F]FRB-D(4) were similar to those with (S,S)-[(18)F]FRB but showed relatively faster blood clearance and no significant in vivo defluorination. Positron emission tomography studies in baboon brain also showed that (S,S)-[(18)F]FRB-D(4) may be a potentially useful ligand for imaging NET with PET.
15880143	Effect of serum withdrawal on the contribution of L-type calcium channels (CaV1.2) to intracellular Ca2+ responses and chemotaxis in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells.	Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) chemotaxis is fundamental to atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+]i is an important signal in chemotaxis, but the role of L-type calcium channels (CaV1.2) in this response in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC) has not been examined. hVSMC were grown from explant cultures of saphenous vein. Confluent hVSMC at passage 3 were studied after culture in medium containing 15% foetal calf serum (FCS) (randomly cycling) or following serum deprivation for up to 7 days. Smooth muscle alpha-actin was measured by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. [Ca2+]i was measured using fura 2 fluorimetry. Chemotaxis was measured using a modified Boyden chamber technique and cell attachment to gelatin-coated plates was also quantified. The number and affinity of dihydropyridine-binding sites was assessed using [5-methyl-3H]PN 200-110 binding. In randomly cycling cells, the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644a and 100 mM KCl did not affect [Ca2+]i. In addition, the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) was unaffected by the CaV1.2 antagonists, amlodipine and verapamil. In randomly cycling cells amlodipine did not affect PDGF-induced migration. In serum-deprived cells, smooth muscle alpha-actin was increased and Bay K 8644a and 100 mM KCl increased [Ca2+]i. PDGF-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were also inhibited by amlodipine and verapamil. The ability of Bay K 8644a to increase [Ca2+]i and verapamil to inhibit PDGF-induced rises in [Ca2+]i was evident within 3 days after serum withdrawal. In serum-deprived hVSMC Bay K 8644a induced chemotaxis and amlodipine inhibited PDGF-induced migration. Cell attachment in the presence of PDGF was unaffected by amlodipine in either randomly cycling or serum-deprived hVSMC. Serum withdrawal was associated with a decrease in the maximum number of dihydropyridine-binding sites (B(max)) and a decrease in affinity (K(D)). Serum deprivation of hVSMC results in increased expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin, a marker of more differentiated status, and increased [Ca2+]i responses and chemotaxis mediated by CaV1.2. These observations may have important implications for understanding the therapeutic benefits of calcium channel antagonists in cardiovascular disease.
15888508	Trazodone and its active metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine as partial agonists at 5-HT1A receptors assessed by [35S]GTPgammaS binding.	Trazodone is an effective antidepressant drug with a broad therapeutic spectrum, including anxiolytic efficacy. Although trazodone is usually referred to as a serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, this pharmacological effect appears to be too weak to fully account for its clinical effectiveness. The present study aimed to elucidate the agonist properties of trazodone and its active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), at 5-HT(1A) receptors by means of the guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding assay. In membranes prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human 5-HT(1A) receptors (CHO/h5-HT(1A)), trazodone behaved as an almost full agonist and m-CPP was also a highly efficacious partial agonist at 5-HT(1A) receptors. The intrinsic activities of both compounds were higher than those of tandospirone and buspirone, which are clinically effective anxiolytics with well-known 5-HT(1A) partial agonist properties. These effects were replicated in the 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated [(35)S]GTPgamma(S) binding assay in native rat brain membranes (at least in hippocampal membranes), although the intrinsic activities of the compounds were low and differently ranked compared to those in CHO/h5-HT(1A) cell membranes. When considering the implications of 5-HT(1A) receptors in anxiety and/or depression, as well as the clinical effectiveness of azapirone anxiolytics with partial 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist properties such as buspirone, it is possible that the agonist effects on 5-HT(1A) receptors of trazodone and its active metabolite m-CPP presented in this study contribute, at least in part, to the clinical efficacy of the atypical antidepressant trazodone.
15893416	The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib fails to inhibit pancreatic cancer progression.	Imatinib targets KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) and is highly effective in the treatment of CML and GIST patients. Pancreatic cancers express KIT and PDGFRs. Therefore, 26 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were randomized to either gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 weekly) or imatinib (2x400 mg po) treatment daily. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was confirmed histologically and expression of KIT and PDGFRbeta was determined immunohistochemically in the biopsy specimens. Quality of life was assessed with two standard questionnaires. No objective responses were seen in either group. Median time to progression was 77 and 29 days (P=0.411) and median survival time was 140 and 60 days (P=0.517) for gemcitabine and imatinib, respectively. Survival and treatment responses were independent of KIT and PDGFRbeta expression in patients treated with imatinib. Grade 3/4 toxicities of imatinib treatment were anemia, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, and dyspnea. Patients treated with imatinib reported diarrhoea and/or altered bowel function more frequently, which were treatable symptomatically. Quality of life was similar in both groups. In this small series of pancreatic cancer patients, treatment with imatinib was not associated with a significant control of cancer progression.
15897880	All-trans retinoic acid treatment of Wilms tumor cells reverses expression of genes associated with high risk and relapse in vivo.	Wilms tumor is one of the most frequent neoplasias in children. Our previous microarray screening in a large series of Wilms tumors revealed several candidate genes that are deregulated in advanced tumors and are part of the retinoic acid signaling pathway. To investigate whether retinoic acid could be employed as a novel therapeutic agent in these tumors, we treated cultured Wilms tumor cells with different concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and assessed gene expression changes by real-time RT-PCR as well as microarray analysis. Several genes like RARRES1, RARRES3, CTGF, CKS2, CCNA2, IGFBP3, UBE2C, CCL2 or ITM2B that were previously found to be deregulated in advanced tumors exhibited opposite expression changes after ATRA treatment. In addition to enhanced retinoid signaling, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) pathway was strongly activated by ATRA treatment of Wilms tumor cells. Both the retinoic acid and the TGFbeta pathway mediate inhibition of cell growth. These findings represent the first molecular evidence of a potential benefit from ATRA treatment in Wilms tumors.
15901795	Pharmacological implications of two distinct mechanisms of interaction of memantine with N-methyl-D-aspartate-gated channels.	Unlike other N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, clinical trials have shown that memantine is clinically tolerated and effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism for memantine tolerability, however, remains contentious but may be partly explained by its uncompetitive antagonism. The specific site of memantine block in the NMDAR channel interacts with magnesium and is assumed to be at or near a narrow constriction representing the channel selectivity filter. A second, very low-affinity site of memantine action has also been reported. Here, using mutational analysis and substituted cysteine accessibility methods on recombinant NR1/NR2A NMDARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we precisely localize both the specific and second memantine-blocking sites. Intriguingly, memantine interacts with its specific blocking site in the same fashion as intracellular rather than extracellular Mg(2+). Thus, the N-site asparagine (N) in the M2 region of the NR1 subunit represents the dominant site for uncompetitive antagonism by memantine. The N and N + 1 site asparagines in NR2A produce strong electrostatic interactions with memantine. In contrast, the second (superficial) memantine-blocking site, located at the extracellular vestibule of the channel, appears to be nonspecific and overlaps the site occupied by the nonspecific pore blocker hexamethonium. Residues in the post-M3 segment of the NR1 subunit are not directly involved in memantine binding. The distinct patterns of interaction and the relative degree of affinity of memantine for these two binding sites contribute to the drug's excellent pharmacological profile of clinical tolerability. In the future, these parameters should be considered in searching for improved neuroprotective agents in this class.
15905177	Headgroup-specific exposure of phospholipids in ABCA1-expressing cells.	ABCA1 has been established to be required for the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoproteins such as apoA-I. At present, it is unclear whether ABCA1-mediated lipid exposure is specific with regard to lipid headgroups and whether it requires calcium activation and the presence of a lipid acceptor. In the present work, we found exofacial exposure of endogenous phosphatidylserine in the absence of apoA-I to be enhanced in ABCA1-GFP expressing MDCKII and HeLa cells compared with control cells. By using C6-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) (NBD)-labeled phospholipid analogues, we observed elevated redistribution of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not of phosphatidylcholine analogues from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane of ABCA1-GFP expressing cells. Whereas glyburide affected neither the level of exofacial endogenous PS nor the outward movement of the amino phospholipid analogues, the latter was sensitive to intracellular Ca2+ in ABCA1-GFP expressing cells, further enhancing outward analogue redistribution with respect to control cells. Both receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluidphase endocytosis were reduced in MDCKII cells expressing ABCA1-GFP. Glyburide raised the level of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the ABCA1-GFP expressing cell to the level of control cells in the absence of glyburide. In control cells, however, fluid-phase endocytosis but not receptor-mediated endocytosis was significantly reduced upon glyburide treatment.
15916724	The role of Akt on arsenic trioxide suppression of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation.	The present study investigates the molecular details of how arsenic trioxide inhibits preadipocyte differentiation and examines the role of Akt/PKB in regulation of differentiation and apoptosis. Continual exposure of arsenic trioxide, at the clinic achievable dosage that does not induce apoptosis, suppressed 3T3-L1 cell differentiation into fat cells by inhibiting the expression of PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha and disrupting the interaction between PPARgamma and RXRalpha, which determines the programming of the adipogenic genes. Interestingly, if we treated the cells for 12 or 24 h and then withdrew arsenic trioxide, the cells were able to differentiate to the comparable levels of untreated cells as assayed by the activity of GAPDH, the biochemical marker of preadipocyte differentiation. Long term treatment blocked the differentiation and the activity of GAPDH could not recover to the comparable levels of untreated cells. Continual exposure of arsenic trioxide caused accumulation in G2/M phase and the accumulation of p21. We found that arsenic trioxide induced the expression and the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and it inhibited the interaction between Akt/PKB and PPARgamma . Akt/PKB inhibitor appears to block the arsenic trioxide suppression of differentiation. Our results suggested that Akt/PKB may play a role in suppression of apoptosis and negatively regulate preadipocyte differentiation.
15917433	A rapid new assay to detect RNA editing reveals antipsychotic-induced changes in serotonin-2C transcripts.	We report the development of a new assay as an alternative to direct DNA sequencing to measure RNA-edited variation in tissue. The new assay has been validated and is accurate, cheaper, more rapid, and less labor-intensive than DNA sequencing. We also outline the statistical modeling required for analyses of the hierarchical, clustered RNA-editing data generated in these studies. Using the new technique, we analyzed the effects of long-term antipsychotic medication on serotonin-2C receptor (5-HT2CR) RNA editing in rat brain. Our hypothesis that a drug with high affinity for 5-HT2CR, such as clozapine, would alter its RNA-editing profile was not confirmed. Whereas haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic drug that is primarily a dopamine receptor antagonist, reduced 5-HT2C VNV isoform frequency and the level of RNA editing at the D site, risperidone and not the prototype atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine increased the frequency of 5-HT2C VNV and D-site editing. Our data emphasize that caution is required in the interpretation of RNA-editing data in studies of psychiatric disorders, because these studies usually include subjects who received long-term exposure to medication. This newly established method will facilitate high-throughput investigations of RNA editing in disease pathology and in the pharmacological activity of drugs.
15917650	Inhibition of c-fms by imatinib: expanding the spectrum of treatment.	Imatinib is a selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It specifically suppresses the growth of bcr-abl expressing CML progenitor cells by blocking the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain of bcr-abl. Imatinib also inhibits the c-abl, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), abl-related gene and stem cell factor receptor, c-kit, protein tyrosine kinases. It is through inhibition of c-kit that imatinib is also used clinically in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours. We have recently demonstrated that imatinib also specifically targets the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor, c-fms, at therapeutic concentrations. Although this finding has important implications with regard to potential side effects in patients currently receiving imatinib therapy, these results suggest that imatinib may also be useful in the treatment of diseases where c-fms is implicated. This includes breast and ovarian cancer and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. We also speculate that imatinib may be used in diseases where bone destruction occurs due to excessive osteoclast activity, such as in the haematologic malignancy, multiple myeloma.
15928087	The target of ezetimibe is Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1).	Ezetimibe is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol absorption that has been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, but its molecular target has been elusive. Using a genetic approach, we recently identified Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) as a critical mediator of cholesterol absorption and an essential component of the ezetimibe-sensitive pathway. To determine whether NPC1L1 is the direct molecular target of ezetimibe, we have developed a binding assay and shown that labeled ezetimibe glucuronide binds specifically to a single site in brush border membranes and to human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing NPC1L1. Moreover, the binding affinities of ezetimibe and several key analogs to recombinant NPC1L1 are virtually identical to those observed for native enterocyte membranes. KD values of ezetimibe glucuronide for mouse, rat, rhesus monkey, and human NPC1L1 are 12,000, 540, 40, and 220 nM, respectively. Last, ezetimibe no longer binds to membranes from NPC1L1 knockout mice. These results unequivocally establish NPC1L1 as the direct target of ezetimibe and should facilitate efforts to identify the molecular mechanism of cholesterol transport.
15929991	(D)-beta-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits adipocyte lipolysis via the nicotinic acid receptor PUMA-G.	As a treatment for dyslipidemia, oral doses of 1-3 grams of nicotinic acid per day lower serum triglycerides, raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce mortality from coronary heart disease (Tavintharan, S., and Kashyap, M. L. (2001) Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 3, 74-82). These benefits likely result from the ability of nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes and thereby reduce serum non-esterified fatty acid levels (Carlson, L. A. (1963) Acta Med. Scand. 173, 719-722). In mice, nicotinic acid inhibits lipolysis via PUMA-G, a Gi/o-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in adipocytes and activated macrophages (Tunaru, S., Kero, J., Schaub, A., Wufka, C., Blaukat, A., Pfeffer, K., and Offermanns, S. (2003) Nat. Med. 9, 352-355). The human ortholog HM74a is also a nicotinic acid receptor and likely has a similar role in anti-lipolysis. Endogenous levels of nicotinic acid are too low to significantly impact receptor activity, hence the natural ligands(s) of HM74a/PUMA-G remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the fatty acid-derived ketone body (D)-beta-hydroxybutyrate ((D)-beta-OHB) specifically activates PUMA-G/HM74a at concentrations observed in serum during fasting. Like nicotinic acid, (D)-beta-OHB inhibits mouse adipocyte lipolysis in a PUMA-G-dependent manner and is thus the first endogenous ligand described for this orphan receptor. These findings suggests a homeostatic mechanism for surviving starvation in which (D)-beta-OHB negatively regulates its own production, thereby preventing ketoacidosis and promoting efficient use of fat stores.
15931068	TRPA1 and TRPM8 activation in humans: effects of cinnamaldehyde and menthol.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychophysical effects of both TRPA1 and TRPM8 activation in humans by application of either cinnamaldehyde or menthol. We applied 10% cinnamaldehyde or 40% menthol solutions on the forearm in 10 study participants. Quantitative sensory testing and laser Doppler imaging was performed before and after exposure to the compounds. Cinnamaldehyde evoked significant spontaneous pain and induced heat and mechanical hyperalgesia, cold hypoalgesia and a neurogenic axon reflex erythema. In contrast, TRPM8 activation by menthol produced no axon reflex reaction and resulted in cold hyperalgesia. We conclude that agonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels produce strikingly different psychophysical patterns.
15937332	Molecular and pharmacological properties of a potent and selective novel nonsteroidal progesterone receptor agonist tanaproget.	Progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have several important applications in women's health, such as in oral contraception and post-menopausal hormone therapy. Currently, all PR agonists used clinically are steroids. Because of their interactions with other steroid receptors, steroid-metabolizing enzymes, or other steroid-signaling pathways, these drugs can pose significant side effects in some women. Efforts to discover novel nonsteroidal PR agonists with improved biological properties led to the discovery of tanaproget (TNPR). TNPR binds to the PR from various species with a higher relative affinity than reference steroidal progestins. In T47D cells, TNPR induces alkaline phosphatase activity with an EC(50) value of 0.1 nm, comparable with potent steroidal progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and trimegestone (TMG), albeit with a reduced efficacy ( approximately 60%). In a mammalian two-hybrid assay to measure PR agonist-induced interaction between steroid receptor co-activator-1 and PR, TNPR showed similar potency (EC(50) value of 0.02 nm) and efficacy to MPA and TMG. Importantly, in key animal models such as the rat ovulation inhibition assay, TNPR demonstrates full efficacy and an enhanced progestational potency (30-fold) when compared with MPA and TMG. Furthermore, TNPR has relatively weak interactions with other steroid receptors and binding proteins and little effect on cytochrome P450 metabolic pathways. Finally, the three-dimensional crystal structure of the PR ligand binding domain with TNPR has been delineated to demonstrate how this nonsteroidal ligand achieves its high binding affinity. Therefore, TNPR is a structurally novel and very selective PR agonist with an improved preclinical pharmacological profile.
15943176	In vivo effect of celecoxib and tenoxicam on oxidant/ anti-oxidant status of patients with knee osteoarthritis.	The aim of this study was to compare the in vivo effects on free radical metabolism of 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): tenoxicam, an oxicam preferentially cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitor, and celecoxib, a sulfonamide selective COX-2 inhibitor. The serum levels of oxidative stress-related enzymes (ie, xanthine oxidase (XO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)), of a lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde (MDA)), and of nitric oxide (NO) in patients with knee osteoarthritis were studied at baseline and after a 4-wk course of treatment with celecoxib (n = 11) and tenoxicam (n = 12). Celecoxib-treated patients had significant decrease in nitrite levels (p = 0.043), whereas SOD, XO, GSH-Px enzyme activities, and MDA levels did not change significantly compared to baseline. Tenoxicam-treated patients had significant decrease in nitrite levels (p = 0.036) and XO activity (p = 0.01), but their SOD, GSH-Px enzyme activities, and MDA levels were unchanged from baseline. There was significant correlation between the patients' (n = 23) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) LK3.0 Osteoarthritis Index, WOMAC-pain scores, and MDA levels (r = 0.50, p = 0.014) and the patients' WOMAC-stiffness scores and XO enzyme activity (r = 0.46, p = 0.027) at baseline. Significant improvement was found in pain-VAS, patients' global assessment, and WOMAC pain, stiffness, and physical function scores in celecoxib and tenoxicam-treated groups. In summary, our study revealed that tenoxicam may have antioxidant effects, and that celecoxib and tenoxicam may reduce nitrite levels, indicating an alteration of NO pathways.
15949566	Coexistence of different clonal populations harboring the b3a2 (p210) and e1a2 (p190) BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts in chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to imatinib.	In this study, we report the case of a Philadelphia (Ph) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient with the presence of p190 and p210 BCR-ABL1 mRNA fusion transcripts derived from e1a2 and b3a2 BCR-ABL1 genomic rearrangements, respectively. The presence of e1a2 BCR-ABL1 genomic rearrangement was seen in 2 different clones, one with the rearrangement and another one with the rearrangement and deletion of the BCR gene of the non-rearranged chromosome 22. After treatment with imatinib, the p210 transcript could not be detected, whereas p190 was still present 6 months after initiation of imatinib therapy and progression to blast phase. The absence of p210 transcript post treatment indicates that the clone with b3a2 responded to imatinib and that the observed resistance was associated to cells harboring the e1a2 genomic rearrangement. Despite resistance of this patient to imatinib, no evidence of mutations in the kinase domain of ABL1 was found. Loss of normal BCR in one cell clone may contribute to the resistance to imatinib due to the lack of BCR mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL1.
15967876	Intracellular K+ is required for the inactivation-induced high-affinity binding of cisapride to HERG channels.	Many commonly used medications can cause long QT syndrome and thus increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. High-affinity human Ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel blockade by structurally diverse compounds is almost exclusively responsible for this side effect. Understanding drug-HERG channel interactions is an important step in avoiding drug-induced long QT syndromes. Previous studies have found that disrupting HERG inactivation reduces the degree of drug block and have suggested that the inactivated state is the preferential state for drug binding to HERG channels. However, recent studies have also shown that inactivation does not dictate drug sensitivity of HERG channels. In the present study, we examined the effect of inactivation gating on cisapride block of HERG. Modulation of HERG inactivation was achieved by either changing extracellular K+ or Cs+ concentrations or by mutations of the channel. We found that although inactivation facilitated cisapride block of the HERG K+ current, it was not coupled with cisapride block of HERG when the Cs+ current was recorded. Furthermore, cisapride block of the HERG K+ current was not linked with inactivation in the mutant HERG channels F656V and F656M. Our results suggest that inactivation facilitates cisapride block of HERG channels through affecting the positioning of Phe-656.
15976447	Glucocorticoids remodel nuclear envelope structure and permeability.	The present study describes glucocorticoid induced remodelling of nuclear envelope (NE) structure and permeability. A glucocorticoid analogue, triamcinolone acetonide (TA), is injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes that express an exogeneous glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Electrical, fluorescence and nano-imaging techniques are applied to study the permeability and the structure of the NE at 5 and 60 minutes after injection of TA. A remarkable dilation of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), a rearrangement of NPC distribution and a significant increase of NE permeability for ions and fluorescent 20 kDa dextran are observed within 5 minutes of TA exposure. At regular distances on local NE patches, NPCs seem to adjoin forming clusters each consisting of several hundred NPCs. Interestingly, at the same time of exposure, hydrophobicity of NPC central channels and NPC-free NE surface increases. The changes in permeability and structure are transient as the NE permeability returns to its initial state within 60 minutes. In conclusion, the NE is a barrier of high plasticity sensitive to hydrophobic molecules. Remodelling of NE structure and permeability is a prerequisite for mediating physiological actions of glucocorticoids.
15982786	Similarities between CSF-brain extracellular transfer and neurofibrillary tangle invasion in Alzheimer's disease.	Using the in vivo enzyme protection-enzyme inhibition method, we visualized the distribution of the intraventricularly and cisternally (cisterna magna) injected ambenonium chloride (Am) bound reversibly to the extracellular acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) in the rabbit brain in order to describe the extracellular flow pathways from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We found that the distribution of Am-protected AChE (indicating the Am itself) is similar to tracers having no intracerebral binding sites. The topographical distribution after both ways of application indicates a preferential penetration of Am into the limbic structures of the cerebral hemispheres in a predictable topographic sequence starting from the corticoid areas, allo- and periallo cortices followed by the mesocortical regions and then, in a limited extent, to the isocortex. The lentiform nuclei and the central part of diencephalic halves are inaccessible to Am. The hierarchic order in the sequence of diffusion from the CSF into the hemispheric subpial regions and the distribution pattern of Am resemble the stereotypic topographic expansion pattern and the predominantly limbic distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.
15986196	Effect of repeated administrations of heroin, naltrexone, methadone, and alcohol on morphine glucuronidation in the rat.	Heroin is rapidly metabolized to morphine that in turn is transformed in morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), an inactive metabolite, and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist. We have found that heroin addicts exhibit higher M6G/M3G ratios relative to morphine-treated control subjects. We have also shown that heroin-treated rats exhibit measurable levels of M6G (which is usually undetectable in this species) and reduced levels of M3G.
15994348	Direct agonist/antagonist functions of dehydroepiandrosterone.	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) exhibits peak adrenal secretion in the fetus at term and around age 30 yr in the adult. Levels then progressively decline, which is associated with decreased levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estrogen in peripheral tissues. DHEA supplementation in postmenopausal women increases bone formation and density, an effect mainly attributed to peripheral conversion to sex hormones. In this study, we tested DHEA for direct effects on the androgen (AR) and estrogen (ER) receptors. DHEA bound to AR with a Ki of 1 microM, which was associated with AR transcriptional antagonism on both the mouse mammary tumor virus and prostate-specific antigen promoters, much like the effects of bicalutamide. Unlike bicalutamide, DHEA stimulated, rather than inhibited, LNCaP cell growth, suggesting possible interaction with other hormone receptors. Indeed DHEA bound to ERalpha and ERbeta, with Ki values of 1.1 and 0.5 microM, respectively. Despite the similar binding affinities, DHEA showed preferential agonism of ERbeta with an EC50 of approximately 200 nm and maximal activation at 1 microM. With ERalpha we found 30-70% agonism at 5 microM, depending on the assay. Physiological levels of DHEA are approximately 30 nM and up to 90 nM in the prostate. DHEA at 30 nM is actually sufficient to activate ERbeta transcription to the same degree as estrogen at its circulating concentration, and additive effects are seen when the two were combined. Taken together, DHEA has the potential for physiologically relevant direct activation of ERbeta. With peak levels at term and age 30 yr, there is also a potential for antagonist effects on AR and partial agonism of ERalpha.
16000430	Susceptibility of Neisseria meningitidis to 16 antimicrobial agents and characterization of resistance mechanisms affecting some agents.	Neisseria meningitidis represents a pathogen of great public health importance in both developed and developing countries. Resistance to some antimicrobial agents used either for therapy of invasive infections or for prophylaxis of case contacts has long been recognized, although specific guidelines for susceptibility testing have not been fully developed. We have examined the susceptibilities of a collection of 442 meningococcal clinical isolates from 15 countries to 16 antimicrobial agents. These included isolates recovered between 1917 and 2004, with representatives of all major serogroups. All isolates were tested by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) broth microdilution method using Mueller-Hinton lysed horse blood broth, while a subset of 102 isolates was tested by agar dilution using Mueller-Hinton sheep blood agar. Most isolates provided adequate growth for MIC determinations by both broth and agar methods. Growth in broth was enhanced by CO(2) incubation and was required for two strains (1.7%). MICs of the study drugs compared favorably between the broth and agar methods (79 to 100% essential agreement), and MICs also generally agreed closely (92 to 100% essential agreement, excluding azithromycin) between broth tests incubated in the two different atmospheres. Elevated penicillin and ampicillin MICs (> or =0.12 microg/ml and > or =0.25 microg/ml, respectively) occurred in 14.3% and 8.6% of strains and were associated with polymorphisms of the penA gene encoding a modified penicillin-binding protein 2. None of the 442 isolates produced beta-lactamase. Elevated tetracycline and doxycycline (but not minocycline) MICs were associated with efflux-mediated resistance encoded by tet(B) in 13 strains. Resistance to sulfisoxazole in 21.7% of strains and to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 21.0% resulted from polymorphisms of folP encoding a modified dihydropteroate synthetase. Seven strains were resistant to rifampin due to mutations in the rpoB gene, and two strains were resistant to chloramphenicol due to production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mediated by catP. Two strains had reduced quinolone susceptibility due to mutations of gyrA. The determination of the susceptibilities of a large group of meningococcal strains (including strains with characterized resistance mechanisms) to 16 antimicrobial agents has served as the essential first step in defining susceptibility testing breakpoints specific for this organism.
16009352	Memantine inhibits ethanol-induced NMDA receptor up-regulation in rat hippocampal neurons.	The present study examined the effect of memantine, an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on ethanol-induced NMDA receptor up-regulation. Primary glutamatergic rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to ethanol and memantine for 5 days. The ethanol-sensitive NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B were quantified by Western immunoblot analysis. Exposure to ethanol (50 mM) caused an increase in the levels of NR1 (137 +/- 11% of untreated control, P = 0.009), NR2A (128 +/- 14%, P = 0.022) and NR2B (136 +/- 19%, P = 0.012). Coincubation with memantine (10 microM) completely blocked the ethanol-induced up-regulation of NR1 (102 +/- 4%), NR2A (95 +/- 7%) and NR2B (105 +/- 13%). No effect of memantine on NR subunit expression was observable, except for NR2A, where a decrease (79 +/- 6%, P = 0.034) was noted. Neither ethanol nor memantine alone or in combination were toxic in the concentrations tested. These results may provide a molecular explanation for beneficial effects of memantine on ethanol-induced glutamatergic hyperexcitability reflected in the ethanol withdrawal syndrome and on the development of ethanol dependence.
16010590	Low folate conditions may enhance the interaction of trifluorothymidine with antifolates in colon cancer cells.	Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is a fluoropyrimidine that is part of the novel combination metabolite TAS-102, in which TFT is combined with a potent thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI). TAS-102 is currently tested as an orally chemotherapeutic agent in different schedules in a phase I study. In its monophosphate form, TFT can inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS) activity after binding to the TS-nucleotide binding site leading to dTTP depletion, and in its triphosphate form TFT is incorporated into DNA, eventually leading to DNA damage. In this in vitro study, we investigated whether TFT could potentiate cytotoxicity of the antifolate-based TS inhibitors AG337 (Nolatrexed), ZD1694 (Raltitrexed) and GW1843; and whether increased TS inhibition or DNA damage would be related to this result.
16012181	Clinical signs, pathophysiology and management of skin toxicity during therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.	The last few years, new therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown their efficacy in the treatment of several types of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR (e.g. cetuximab, panitumumab) or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib, erlotinib) are generally well tolerated and do not have the severe systemic side-effects usually seen with cytotoxic drugs. A considerable number of patients treated with these EGFR inhibitors, however, develop dermatological side-effects, most frequently an acneiform eruption but also xerosis, eczema, fissures, telangiectasia, hyperpigmentation, hair changes and paronychia with pyogenic granuloma. These skin effects appear to be mechanism-based linked to the inhibition of EGFR action but the exact pathophysiology remains elusive. Left untreated these dermatological side-effects could represent a threat to patient compliance. Therefore effective management is mandatory. Mild cases of acneiform eruption respond well to topical anti-inflammatory acne therapy, whereas tetracyclines are needed to treat moderate to severe cases. This review outlines the broad spectrum of cutaneous side-effects of EGFR inhibitors, discusses possible underlying mechanisms and provides practical guidelines for the management based on literature data and on personal experience.
16038799	Beta-arrestin2 enhances beta2-adrenergic receptor-mediated nuclear translocation of ERK.	Beta-arrestin mediates desensitization and internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs), but also acts as a scaffold protein in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Thus, we have examined the role of beta-arrestin2 in the betaAR-mediated ERK signaling pathways. Isoproterenol stimulation equally activated cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK in COS-7 cells expressing beta1AR or beta2AR. However, the activity of nuclear ERK was enhanced by co-expression of beta-arrestin2 in beta2AR-but not beta1AR-expressing cells. Pertussis toxin treatment and blockade of Gbetagamma action inhibited beta-arrestin2-enhanced nuclear activation of ERK, suggesting that beta-arrestin2 promotes nuclear ERK localization in a Gbetagamma dependent mechanism upon receptor stimulation. beta2AR containing the carboxyl terminal region of beta1AR lost the beta-arrestin2-promoted nuclear translocation. As the carboxyl terminal region is important for beta-arrestin binding, these results demonstrate that recruitment of beta-arrestin2 to carboxyl terminal region of beta2AR is important for ERK localization to the nucleus.
16041196	A mechanism for the potential proarrhythmic effect of acidosis, bradycardia, and hypokalemia on the blockade of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels.	Many drugs are proarrhythmic by inhibiting the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr). In this study, we use quinidine as an example of highly proarrhythmic agent to investigate the risk factors that may facilitate the proarrhythmic effects of drugs. We studied the influence of pacing, extracellular potassium, and pH on quinidine's IKr blocking effect, all potential factors influencing quinidine's cardiac toxicity. Since the HERG gene encodes IKr, we studied quinidine's effect on HERG expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the 2-electrode voltage clamp technique. When extracellular K+ was 5 mmol/L, quinidine blocked the HERG current dose dependently, with an IC50 of 6.3 +/- 0.2 micromol/L. The blockade was much more prominent at more positive membrane potentials. The inhibition of HERG by quinidine was not use dependent. There was no significant difference between block with or without pacing. When extracellular K+ was lowered to 2.5 mmol/L, the current inhibition by quinidine was enhanced, and IC50 decreased to 4.6 +/- 0.5 micromol/L. At 10 mmol/L extracellular K+, there was less inhibition by quinidine and the IC50 was 11.2 +/- 3.1 micromol/L. Extracellular acidification decreased both steady state and tail currents of HERG. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of quinidine on IKr was decreased with extracellular acidification, which may produce heterogeneity in the repolarization between normal and ischemic cardiac tissue. Thus, the use-independent blockade of IKr by QT-prolonging agents such as quinidine may contribute to cardiac toxicity with bradycardia, hypokalemia, and acidosis further exaggerating the proarrhythmic potential of these agents.
16041398	A comparison of the effects of unfractionated heparin, dalteparin and danaparoid on vascular endothelial growth factor-induced tumour angiogenesis and heparanase activity.	Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is the most common complication of solid tumours. In this study, the effectiveness of three polysaccharide anticoagulants (PSAs), at therapeutic doses, at inhibiting solid tumour growth was investigated. Mice with tumour xenografts were subcutaneously injected with either unfractionated heparin (UFH; 200 units kg(-1) day(-1)), dalteparin (75 units kg(-1) day(-1)) or danaparoid (50 units kg(-1) day(-1)). At these concentrations, these PSAs are equieffective at inhibiting blood coagulation activated factor X. In mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumours dalteparin and, to a lesser extent, UFH inhibited both tumour growth and angiogenesis, whereas danaparoid did not. In contrast, in mice with KLN205 tumours, all the PSAs inhibited tumour growth and angiogenesis. All the PSAs significantly inhibited proliferation, migration of endothelial cells and vessel formation in matrigel plugs containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there were no significant differences between these effects of the PSAs. The PSAs had no effect on endothelial cell tubular formation in vitro. Although all the PSAs inhibited VEGF production in KLN205 tumours in vivo and cells in vitro, in LLC tumours and cells only UFH and dalteparin inhibited VEGF production, whereas danaparoid did not. In both LLC and KLN205 tumours in vivo, heparanase activity was inhibited by UFH and dalteparin, but not by danaparoid. Hence, UFH and dalteparin may be more effective than danaparoid at inhibiting cancer progression in DIC patients with solid tumours, due at least in part to their ability to suppress VEGF and heparanase in tumours.
16060857	Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a survival factor.	NGAL (human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and its mouse analogue 24p3 are members of the lipocalin family of small secreted proteins. These proteins are up-regulated in a number of pathological conditions, including cancers, and may function as transporters of essential factors. Although previous publications have suggested that 24p3 has pro-apoptotic functions, other data are more suggestive of a survival function. The current study was designed to determine whether NGAL is pro- or anti-apoptotic. Apoptosis induced in human adenocarcinoma A549 cells by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating-protein inhibitor MK886, or several celecoxib-derived PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) inhibitors that are devoid of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitory activity, was accompanied by a dose- and time-dependent increase of NGAL mRNA levels, as was reported previously with 24p3. A similar induction of NGAL mRNA was observed in human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with MK886, indicating this was not a cell-specific effect. Treatment of A549 cells with up to 150 mug/10(6) cells of purified recombinant NGAL protein had no effect on viability, whereas antisera against the full-length NGAL protein induced apoptosis in these cells. The stable overexpression of NGAL in A549 cells had no effect on proliferation or viability. However, the cell death induced by a PDK1 inhibitor was reduced by 50% in NGAL-overexpressing cells. Decreasing NGAL mRNA and protein expression with siRNA (small interfering RNA) in A549 cells increased the toxicity of a PDK1 inhibitor by approx. 45%. These data indicate that, although the induction of NGAL correlates with apoptosis, this induction represents a survival response. Because NGAL is a secreted protein, it may play an extracellular role in cell defence against toxicants and/or facilitate the survival of the remaining cells.
16080974	Hemodynamic effects of inhaled nitric oxide and phosphodiesterase inhibitor (dipyridamole) on secondary pulmonary hypertension following heart valve surgery in adults.	Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is proposed in the management of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Secondary PH related to a long-standing heart valve disease however may be refractory to iNO. Aim of this prospective study was to determine whether the combination of iNO plus dipyridamole (DP), a cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5), may enhance and/or prolong the response to iNO in adult patients with secondary valve-related PH undergoing cardiac surgery, and attenuate rebound events related to its discontinuation.
16082424	Polymorphic variants of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene and ADRB2-related propanolol-induced dyslipidemia in the Colombian population.	Different polymorphisms of the ADRB2 gene encoding the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) are associated with changes in a variety of responses of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). In this study, we have investigated the distribution of frequencies of ADRB2-related allelic variants (Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu, Thr164Ile) in the Colombian population, as well as the influence of the Gln27Glu polymorphism as a risk factor for the development of dyslipidemia following propranolol administration. Genotyping was performed in unrelated Colombian volunteers, using PCR-RFLP methods. To examine the association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism of the ADRB2 gene and dyslipidemia induced by propranolol, we recruited 19 healthy individuals who were homozygous for either the Gln27 (wild-type, N = 11) or the Glu27 (homozygous mutant, N = 8) genotype. Electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), serum lipid levels (T-CHO, HDL-CHO, TG), and fibrinogen were determined before and after propranolol administration. The distribution of genotypes was as follows: Arg16Arg 46%, Arg16Gly 47.4%, Gly16Gly 6.6%, Gln27Gln 44.7%, Gln27Glu 48.2%, and Glu27Glu 7.1%, with allelic frequencies of 69.7% for Arg16, 30.3% for Gly16, 68.8% for Gln27, and 31.2% for Glu27. The Thr164Ile polymorphism was found only in one subject, who was heterozygous for the isoleucine variant. Significant changes in physiological parameters (HR, SBP, DBP) have been found in association with ADRB2 variants in both native and mutant subgroups after propranolol intake. HDL-CHO levels diminished (p = 0.005) in native homozygous individuals (Gln27Gln), whereas TG levels were found increased (p = 0.012) in the mutant homozygous individuals (Glu27Glu). T-CHO levels and serum fibrinogen levels remained unaltered in both subgroups. The evidence that subjects homozygous for Gln27 in the ADRB2 gene show a significant reduction of HDL-CHO levels, as well as the increased TG levels in subjects homozygous for Glu27 after propranolol administration, suggest that the Gln27Glu polymorphism represents a risk factor for dyslipidemia induced by propranolol. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia induced by ADRB2 antagonists.
16085334	Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) in cirrhotic liver: a new target to treat portal hypertension?	In liver cirrhosis atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) decreases portal vascular resistance and tributary flow. The enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degrades ANP and bradykinin and generates endothelin-1 from big-endothelin. We determined the effects of NEP inhibition by candoxatrilat on hormonal status, liver function and arterial and portal pressures in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis.
16087693	A phase II trial of imatinib (ST1571) in patients with c-kit expressing relapsed small-cell lung cancer: a CALGB and NCCTG study.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent and refractory c-kit-expressing small-cell lung cancer.
16091048	Identification and structural characterization of an unusual mycobacterial monomeromycolyl-diacylglycerol.	Systematic thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of apolar lipids in Mycobacterium kansasii revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized novel component. The product was ubiquitously found in a panel of M. kansasii clinical isolates, as well as other pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species. TLC analysis of [(14)C]-acetate- or [(14)C]-glycerol-labelled M. kansasii cultures tentatively assigned the novel product as an unusual triacylglycerol-related lipid. Subsequent purification, followed by structural determination using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electrospray mass spectrometry (ES/MS), led to the identification of this product as a monomeromycolyl-diacylglycerol (MMDAG). Treatment of M. kansasii with either isoniazid (INH), a well-known type II fatty acid synthase (FAS-II) and mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor, or tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), a drug approved for treating obesity, correlated with a reduced incorporation of [(14)C]-acetate into both mycolic acids and MMDAG. Addition of INH or THL to the cultures induced major morphological changes and, surprisingly, resulted in an increased number of lipid storage bodies, as determined by electron microscopy. The potent antimycobacterial activity of THL was confirmed against a variety of mycobacterial species, including INH-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Therefore, THL and other beta-lactones may be promising drugs for the development of new antitubercular therapy.
16099840	Characterization of determinants of ligand binding to the nicotinic acid receptor GPR109A (HM74A/PUMA-G).	The G-protein-coupled receptor GPR109A (HM74A/PUMA-G) has recently been shown to function as a receptor for nicotinic acid (niacin) and to mediate its antilipolytic effects. Nicotinic acid is able to strongly raise plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a property that distinguishes nicotinic acid from other lipid-lowering drugs. To investigate the structural determinants of GPR109A ligand binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of putative ligand binding residues combined with generation of chimeric receptors consisting of GPR109A and its close relative GPR109B, which does not bind nicotinic acid. We could identify Asn86/Trp91 [transmembrane helix (TMH) 2/extracellular loop (ECL) 1], Arg111 (TMH3), Ser178 (ECL2), Phe276 (TMH7), and Tyr284 (TMH7) as amino acid residues critical for binding of nicotinic acid. Together with data from molecular modeling studies, our data suggest that the ligand binding pocket for nicotinic acid of GPR109A is distinct from that of most other group A receptors. Although Arg111 at TMH3 serves as the basic anchor point for the carboxylate ligands, the ring system of nicotinic acid is embedded between Trp91 at the junction TMH2/ECL1 and Phe276/Tyr284 at TMH7. The heterocyclic ring is also bound to Ser178 at ECL2 via an H-bond. These data will facilitate the design of new antidyslipidemic drugs acting via GPR109A.
16109140	Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism.	Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) remains an inevitable consequence of untreated chronic uremia. It is the result of a combination of phosphate (P) retention, failure of calcitriol synthesis, and hypocalcemia. Therapies used to correct these abnormalities, namely active vitamin D replacement, calcium (Ca) supplementation, and phosphate (P) restriction, have moderate efficacy but are prone to unacceptable side-effects. However, there have been new developments in the control of P, vitamin D replacement and modulation of the Ca sensing receptor (CaSR) using calcimimetics. Sevelamer, and in the near future lanthanum, are offering a reasonable level of P control without the toxicities inherent with either aluminum- or Ca-based phosphate binders, and other phosphate binders are in development. 'Non calcemic' vitamin D metabolites include 22-oxacalcitriol, paricalcitol, and doxercalciferol. In various experimental models 22-oxacalcitriol, in particular, exhibits impressive suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with minimal calcemia, although it has been less impressive when compared with calcitriol in controlled studies in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The advantages of these agents over conventional treatment with calcitriol or alfacalcidol remain uncertain. Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic agent that up-regulates the sensitivity of the CaSR in parathyroid and other cells, is a new type of therapy for SHPT that simultaneously reduces the concentrations of PTH, Ca, and P in HD patients, enabling a significant number to achieve K/DOQI or other national guidelines. The extent to which this new therapy will improve clinical outcomes remains uncertain. In conclusion, with the advent of new therapies the emphasis in the management of SHPT has evolved to incorporate reduction of Ca loading, control of PTH within specific target ranges, and avoidance of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and elevation of the calcium phosphorus product.
16116337	2-bromoethylamine, a suicide inhibitor of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, increases hydralazine hypotension in rats.	Previous work has shown that inhibitors of the predominantly vascular enzyme semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) potentiate the hypotensive response to hydralazine, itself a SSAO inhibitor, in anesthetized rats. The present study was carried out to determine whether the recently described suicide SSAO inhibitor 2-bromoethylamine shares this effect. Hypotensive responses to hydralazine, 0.1 mg/kg IV, were obtained in chloralose-urethane-anesthetized rats, either unpretreated or receiving bromoethylamine at different doses and pretreatment intervals. Parallel experiments were run with semicarbazide, the prototypical hydrazine SSAO inhibitor. Both inhibitors potentiated hydralazine hypotension, bromoethylamine having a longer latency and a shorter duration of action than semicarbazide. High doses of bromoethylamine did not produce potentiation, a phenomenon attributed to SSAO inactivation by excess substrate and decreased formation by the enzyme of the inhibitor product. Experiments with combined administration of both inhibitors were also carried out. When semicarbazide was administered before bromoethylamine, potentiaton was prevented, apparently by a mechanism similar to the above; when it was given after the amine, potentiation was increased. This was attributed to enzyme inhibition by interaction with 2 different active sites. The charactertistics of hydralazine potentiation by bromoethylamine were considered compatible with the mechanism of SSAO inhibition by the amine.
16126915	Central angiotensin II controls alcohol consumption via its AT1 receptor.	Pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been found to alter the voluntary consumption of alcohol. Here we characterize the role of central angiotensin II (Ang II) in alcohol intake first by using transgenic rats that express an antisense RNA against angiotensinogen and consequently have reduced Ang II levels exclusively in the central nervous system [TGR(ASrAOGEN)680]. These rats consumed markedly less alcohol in comparison to their wild-type controls. Second, Spirapril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which passes the blood-brain barrier, did not influence the alcohol consumption in the TGR(ASrAOGEN)680, but it significantly reduced alcohol intake in wild-type rats. Studies in knockout mice indicated that the central effect of Ang II on alcohol consumption is mediated by the angiotensin receptor AT1 whereas the AT2 receptor and the bradykinin B2 receptor are not involved. Furthermore, the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is markedly reduced in rats with low central Ang II, strengthening our hypothesis of a role of dopaminergic transmission in Ang II-controlled alcohol preference. Our results indicate that a distinct drug-mediated control of the central RAS could be a promising therapy for alcohol disease.
16138927	Sulindac metabolites inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor activation and expression.	Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a decreased mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). NSAIDs induce apoptotic cell death in colon cancer cells in vitro and inhibit growth of neoplastic colonic mucosa in vivo however, the biochemical mechanisms required for these growth inhibitory effects are not well defined. We previously reported that metabolites of the NSAID sulindac downregulate extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling and that this effect is both necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic effects of these drugs. The goal of this project was to specifically test the hypothesis that sulindac metabolites block activation and/or expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR).
16139169	Post-mortem human brain autoradiography of the norepinephrine transporter using (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2.	The binding of the norepinephrine transporter radioligand, (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2, to human brain post-mortem was examined in vitro by whole hemisphere autoradiography. The rank order for the density of labelling was: locus coeruleus>cortex approximately cerebellum approximately thalamus>caudate approximately putamen. The NET-selectivity of binding was confirmed by co-incubation with desipramine. The dual NET/SERT inhibitor duloxetine also inhibited specific binding, whereas PE2I or citalopram had no evident effect.
16140280	A comparison of the chronic treatment effects of venlafaxine and other antidepressants on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters.	Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Serotonergic effects occur with lower doses, whereas both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects occur with higher doses of venlafaxine. Chronic treatment of rats with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors decreases SERT binding sites, whereas similar treatment with selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors decreases NET binding sites. We hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of SERT binding sites and higher doses reducing both SERT and NET binding sites.
16144296	Open-label pilot study of alitretinoin gel 0.1% in the treatment of photoaging.	Alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid) is an FDA-approved topical therapy for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma. Alitretinoin is a naturally occurring endogenous retinoid that binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoic acid receptor (RAR) subtypes alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoic X receptor (RXR) subtypes alpha, beta, and gamma. Photoaging of the skin is the result of accumulated exposure to solar UV radiation. Several topically applied retinoids have been proven clinically effective for treating the appearance of photoaging. Tretinoin and tazarotene, which have been shown to improve photodamaged skin, bind RAR subtypes only. The theoretic benefit of alitretinoin gel 0.1% (Panretin) in the treatment of photoaged skin stems from the binding and activation of both RARs and RXRs, which promote the repair mechanisms in damaged skin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical alitretinoin gel 0.1% in the treatment of photodamaged skin. The treatment was well tolerated by participants (N=20) and subjectively showed improvement of benign skin lesions (eg, seborrheic keratoses) and precancerous lesions (eg, actinic keratoses). Larger, blinded, controlled trials are needed to investigate the role of this novel retinoid in the treatment of photoaging.
16148027	Regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, neurotrophic factors, and APP processing in the neurorescue activity of propargylamine.	The anti-Parkinson drug, rasagiline (N-propargyl-(1R)-aminoindan) promotes neuronal survival, via neuroprotective activity related to its propargyl moiety (propargylamine). We have investigated the neurorescue effects of propargylamine, in a progressive neuronal death model, induced by long-term serum deprivation in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Propargylamine (0.1-10 microM) dose-dependently reduced the levels of the early apoptosis-associated phosphorylated protein, H2A-X (ser 139), as well as decreased the cleavage of caspase-3 and its substrate poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In addition, the compound markedly reversed the apoptotic effects induced by long-term serum withdrawal, including down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, as well as up-regulation of the proapoptotic proteins, Bax, Bad, and Bim. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that propargylamine elevated gene expression levels of Bcl-2, and the neurotrophic factors glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced Bax gene expression. Serum deprivation increased mRNA and protein levels of holo-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which was markedly decreased by propargylamine. This was accompanied by inducing the release of the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase form of soluble APP (sAPPalpha) into the medium. Similar effects on cell survival and APP regulation/processing were demonstrated for rasagiline. These results indicate that both rasagiline and propargylamine possess neurorescue activity, associated with regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, neurotrophic factors, and APP metabolism.
16153117	Protein-acrylamide copolymer hydrogels for array-based detection of tyrosine kinase activity from cell lysates.	We describe the development of an array-based assay for the molecular level detection of tyrosine kinase activity directly from cellular extracts. Glutathione S-transferase-Crkl (GST-Crkl) fusion proteins are covalently immobilized into polyacrylamide gel pads via copolymerization of acrylic monomer and acrylic-functionalized GST-Crkl protein constructs on a polyacrylamide surface. The resulting hydrogels resist nonspecific protein adsorption, permitting quantitative and reproducible determination of Abl tyrosine kinase activity and inhibition, even in the presence of a complex cell lysate mixture. Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) values for imatinib mesylate inhibition of GST-Crkl (SH3) phosphorylation by v-Abl in a purified system and Bcr-Abl within a K562 cell lysate were determined to be 1.5 and 20 microM, respectively. Additionally, the protein-acrylamide copolymer arrays detected CML cell levels as low as 15% in a background of Bcr-Abl- leukemic cells and provided the framework for the parallel evaluation of six tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Such a system may have direct application to the detection and treatment of cancers resulting from upregulated tyrosine kinase activity, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). These findings also establish a basis for screening tyrosine kinase inhibitors and provide a framework on which protein-protein interactions in other complex systems can be studied.
16157482	Quantitative analysis of gene regulation by seven clinically relevant progestins suggests a highly similar mechanism of action through progesterone receptors in T47D breast cancer cells.	Progesterone (P4) is an essential reproductive steroid hormone required for many aspects of female reproductive physiology. Progestins are compounds that demonstrate progesterone-like activity and are used in oral contraception, hormone therapy, and treatment of some reproductive disorders, but differ widely in their chemical structures, potency, and pharmacokinetics. While numerous studies have assessed progestins on specific endpoints, little is known about the activation of global gene expression by progestins. We used Affymetrix GeneChip U133A expression arrays to examine the action of P4 and six clinically relevant synthetic progestins (3-ketodesogestrel, drospirenone, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, and trimegestone) on the progesterone receptor (PR)-positive T47Dco and the PR-negative T47D-Y breast cancer cell lines. Excluding drospirenone, one or more of the progestins-regulated 329 genes, with 30 genes regulated by at least 2.0-fold by all progestins in the T47Dco cells. The synthetic progestins show a high degree of similarity in their transcriptional responses, and each progestin regulates between 77 and 91% of the genes regulated by P4. Independent quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a similar regulation for S100P, PPL, IL20RA, NET1, ATP1A1, HIG2, and CXCL12 (SDF-1) by all seven progestins. Attempts to find differentially regulated genes by any progestin compared to all other treatments failed, suggesting any differences are quantitative, not qualitative. This analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity among these progestins on PR-regulated gene expression in T47D cells, suggesting a similar and fairly specific mode of action.
16170366	FMS receptor for M-CSF (CSF-1) is sensitive to the kinase inhibitor imatinib and mutation of Asp-802 to Val confers resistance.	The kinase inhibitor imatinib is used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, where it targets the intracellular Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours, where it targets either the KIT or PDGF tyrosine kinase receptors. Here, we report that imatinib is also an effective inhibitor of the closely related FMS receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor and that mutation of Asp 802 of FMS to Val confers imatinib resistance. Imatinib readily reverted the transformed phenotype of haemopoietic and fibroblast cell lines that express the oncogene v-fms and also inhibited the growth of the Bacl.2F5 macrophage cell line. The cellular IC50 value of imatinib for FMS was similar to those for Bcr-Abl and KIT. Consequently, imatinib may also prove effective for the treatment of diseases whose progression is dependent upon macrophage-colony stimulating factor, this includes certain aspects of cancer and inflammation.
16177222	Stimulation of the ADRB3 adrenergic receptor induces relaxation of human placental arteries: influence of preeclampsia.	Preeclampsia, which complicates 3-8% of pregnancies, is one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence and the role of beta2- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2 and ADRB3, respectively) in human placental arteries and to assess the influence of preeclampsia on ADRB responsiveness. SR 59119A, salbutamol, and isoproterenol (ADRB3, ADRB2, and nonselective ADRB agonists, respectively) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of placental artery rings obtained from women with uncomplicated or preeclamptic pregnancies. SR 59119A-induced relaxation was unaffected by the blockade of ADRB1 and ADRB2 by 0.1 microM propranolol but was significantly decreased by the blockade of ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 by 10 microM propranolol. Both SR 59119A and salbutamol were associated with a significant increase in cAMP production that was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 0.1 microM propranolol only for salbutamol. SR 59119A-induced relaxation (E(max) = 28% +/- 5% vs. 45% +/- 4%, respectively) and cAMP production (2.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.4 pmol/mg of protein, respectively; P < 0.01) were decreased in arteries obtained from preeclamptic compared to normotensive women. Both ADRB2 and ADRB3 transcripts were expressed at the same level between arteries from normotensive and preeclamptic women. Western blot analysis, however, revealed a decreased expression of the ADRB3 immunoreactive protein in arteries from preeclamptic compared to normotensive women. We suggest the presence of functional ADRB2 and ADRB3 in human placental arteries. Even if preeclampsia is associated with an impairment of the ADRB3 responsiveness, ADRB3 agonists may have future pharmaceutical implications in the management of pregnancy-related disorders.
16182256	Clozapine and haloperidol differentially alter the constitutive activity of central serotonin2C receptors in vivo.	Central serotonin2C (5-HT2C) receptors are known to play a role in the mechanism of action of the antipsychotic drugs (APDs) clozapine and haloperidol. However, evidence for the involvement of the constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors in the dopamine (DA)ergic effects of APDs is lacking in vivo.
16184369	Carbidopa pretreatment improves image interpretation and visualisation of carcinoid tumours with 11C-5-hydroxytryptophan positron emission tomography.	Positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) as tracer is a promising imaging instrument in the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). However, high radioactivity concentrations in the urinary collecting system sometimes produce image reconstruction artefacts that can make detection of small NETs difficult. As a means to decrease urinary excretion of radioactivity and thereby improve image quality, we examined the effect of pretreatment with carbidopa (CD), a peripheral inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which converts 5-HTP to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT).
16199482	Metabolite ligands of estrogen receptor-beta reduce primate coronary hyperreactivity.	Previous reports showed that 17beta-estradiol implants attenuate in vivo coronary hyperreactivity (CH), characterized by long-duration vasoconstrictions (in coronary angiographic experiments), in menopausal rhesus monkeys. Prolonged Ca2+ contraction signals that correspond with CH in coronary vascular muscle cells (VMC) to the same dual-constrictor stimulus, serotonin + the thromboxane analog U-46619, in estrogen-deprived VMC were suppressed by >72 h in 17beta-estradiol. The purpose of this study was to test whether an endogenous estrogen metabolite with estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta) binding activity, estriol (E3), suppresses in vivo and in vitro CH. E3 treatment in vivo for 4 wk significantly attenuated the angiographically evaluated vasoconstrictor response to intracoronary serotonin + U-46619 challenge. In vitro treatment of rhesus coronary VMC for >72 h with nanomolar E3 attenuated late Ca2+ signals. This reduction of late Ca2+ signals also appeared after >72 h of treatment with subnanomolar 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-Adiol), an endogenous dihydrotestosterone metabolite with ER-beta binding activity. R,R-tetrahydrochrysene, a selective ER-beta antagonist, significantly blocked the E3- and 3beta-Adiol-mediated attenuation of late Ca2+ signal increases. ER-beta and thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TPR) were coexpressed in coronary arteries and aorta. In vivo E3 treatment attenuated aortic TPR expression. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with E3 or 3beta-Adiol downregulated TPR expression in VMC, which was blocked for both agonists by pretreatment with R,R-tetrahydrochrysene. E3- and 3beta-Adiol-mediated reduction in persistent Ca2+ signals is associated with ER-beta-mediated attenuation of TPR expression and may partly explain estrogen benefits in coronary vascular muscle.
16205964	Immunohistochemical analysis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl, and arg proteins in glioblastoma: possible implications for patient selection for imatinib mesylate therapy.	Inhibition of tyrosine kinase (TK) receptors by synthetic small molecules has become a promising new therapy option in oncology. The TK inhibitor imatinib mesylate selectively targets PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg and has proven successful in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. In recurrent glioblastoma, phase II therapy trials using imatinib mesylate have been initiated. As only a fraction of patients seems to benefit from imatinib mesylate therapy and due to potential side effects and high costs of imatinib mesylate therapy, selection of the right patients is important. The goal of our study was to assess systematically immunohistochemical expression of the major TKs targeted by imatinib mesylate in glioblastoma, as expression of these factors could be used to select patients for imatinib mesylate therapy. In a cohort of 101 glioblastoma patients, anti-PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg protein immunohistochemistry was performed. Expression of these proteins was assessed semi-quantitatively and correlated with patient survival.PDGFR-alpha and arg expression in tumor cells was widespread in 1/101 cases, respectively. Focal PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg immunolabeling was detected in 25/101, 19/101, 4/101, 7/101 and 31/101 cases, respectively. Statistical analysis did not reveal any correlation between expression of the TKs and patient survival. We show here for the first time in a large series of glioblastomas that PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg expression is immunohistochemically detectable in a fraction of cases. The value of anti-tyrosine kinase immunolabeling as predictive factor for patient selection remains to be clarified by comparative analysis of tumor tissue of therapy-responders versus non-responders.
1620654	Activation of CCK-A receptors induces elevation of plasma corticosterone in rats.	Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and ceruletide (1 microgram/kg) produced a pronounced increment of plasma corticosterone levels at 30 min after intraperitoneal administration. The response to these peptides was suppressed by pretreatment with a selective antagonist for CCK-A receptors, (-)L-364,718, in a dose-related manner, but not with an antagonist for CCK-B receptors, (+)L-365,260. However, (-)L-364,718 itself had no effect on basal levels of plasma corticosterone. These results indicate that peripheral administration of CCK-8 and ceruletide stimulates the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis through the activation of CCK-A receptors, but not CCK-B receptors.
16234514	retrospective analysis of topoisomerase IIa amplifications and deletions as predictive markers in primary breast cancer patients randomly assigned to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil: Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.	The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of HER2 and topoisomerase IIalpha gene (TOP2A) for the efficacy of epirubicin in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer patients.
16237394	The effect of olanzapine on craving and alcohol consumption.	Previous studies have indicated that olanzapine decreases craving after a priming dose of alcohol, that craving after a priming dose of alcohol is greater among individuals with the seven-repeat allele of the DRD4 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism, and that the effect of olanzapine (a D2/D4 antagonist) is more pronounced among individuals with this allele. The present study tested the hypothesis that olanzapine may be differentially effective at reducing cue-elicited craving and differentially effective as a treatment for alcohol dependence over the course of a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among individuals with and without the seven-repeat allele. Participants who met DSM IV criteria for alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (5 mg) or a placebo over the course of the trial. After 2 weeks of treatment, participants completed a cue reactivity assessment. The results suggested that participants who were homozygous or heterozygous for the seven (or longer)-repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR responded to olanzapine with reductions in cue-elicited craving as well as reductions in alcohol consumption over the course of the 12-week trial, whereas individuals with the shorter alleles did not respond favorably to olanzapine.
16243998	The effects of anesthetics and ethanol on alpha2 adrenoceptor subtypes expressed with G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels in Xenopus oocytes.	A wide range of physiological effects are mediated by alpha2-adrenoceptors (ARs) through their association with G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Although alpha2-ARs are divided into three subtypes (alpha2A-C), a pharmacological distinction among the subtypes is difficult to establish because of the lack of a selective agonist and antagonist; therefore, little is known about the effects of anesthetics on the alpha2-AR subtypes. We expressed each subtype together with GIRK1/GIRK2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes and observed alpha2-AR-mediated GIRK1/GIRK2 currents to test the effects of ethanol, halothane, and several IV anesthetics at clinical concentrations. UK 14,304, a selective alpha2-AR agonist, evoked GIRK1/GIRK2 currents in every subtype. None of the IV anesthetics, which included pentobarbital, propofol, ketamine, and alphaxalone, influenced UK 14,304-evoked potassium currents in any of the receptor subtypes. Ethanol enhanced the UK 14,304-evoked potassium currents, whereas halothane inhibited the currents. However, these effects were not significantly different from those on the baseline-GIRK1/GIRK2 current, suggesting that neither ethanol nor halothane acts directly on the alpha2-AR subtypes. Although none of the drugs examined had any effect on the alpha2-ARs, the physiological actions of the alpha2-ARs mediated by the GIRK1/GIRK2 channels may be affected by ethanol and halothane.
16249494	The effects of prostaglandin analogues on IOP in prostanoid FP-receptor-deficient mice.	This study was designed to clarify the involvement of the prostanoid FP receptor in the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone with the use of FP-receptor-deficient (FPKO) mice.
16263802	Glucocorticoid regulation of genes in the amiloride-sensitive sodium transport pathway by semicircular canal duct epithelium of neonatal rat.	The lumen of the inner ear has an unusually low concentration of endolymphatic Na+, which is important for transduction processes. We have recently shown that glucocorticoid receptors (GR) stimulate absorption of Na+ by semicircular canal duct (SCCD) epithelia. In the present study, we sought to determine the presence of genes involved in the control of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport pathway in rat SCCD epithelia and whether their level of expression was regulated by glucocorticoids using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Transcripts were present for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC); the alpha1-, alpha3-, beta1-, and beta3-isoforms of Na+-K+-ATPase; inwardly rectifying potassium channels [IC50 of short circuit current (Isc) for Ba2+: 210 microM] Kir2.1, Kir2.2, Kir2.3, Kir2.4, Kir3.1, Kir3.3, Kir4.1, Kir4.2, Kir5.1, and Kir7.1; sulfonyl urea receptor 1 (SUR1); GR; mineralocorticoid receptor (MR); 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) types 1 and 2; serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1); and neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4-2 (Nedd4-2). On the other hand, transcripts for the alpha4-subunit of Na+-K+-ATPase, Kir1.1, Kir3.2, Kir3.4, Kir6.1, Kir6.2, and SUR2 were found to be absent, and Isc was not inhibited by glibenclamide. Dexamethasone (100 nM for 24 h) not only upregulated the transcript expression of alpha-ENaC (approximately 4-fold), beta2-subunit (approximately 2-fold) and beta3-subunit (approximately 8-fold) of Na+-K+-ATPase, Kir2.1 (approximately 5-fold), Kir2.2 (approximately 9-fold), Kir2.4 (approximately 3-fold), Kir3.1 (approximately 3- fold), Kir3.3 (approximately 2-fold), Kir4.2 (approximately 3-fold), Kir7.1 (approximately 2-fold), Sgk1 (approximately 4-fold), and Nedd4-2 (approximately 2-fold) but also downregulated GR (approximately 3-fold) and 11beta-HSD1 (approximately 2-fold). Expression of GR and 11beta-HSD1 was higher than MR and 11beta-HSD2 in the absence of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone altered transcript expression levels (alpha-ENaC and Sgk1) by activation of GR but not MR. Proteins were present for the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of ENaC and Sgk1, and expression of alpha- and gamma-ENaC was upregulated by dexamethasone. These findings are consistent with the genomic stimulation by glucocorticoids of Na+ absorption by SCCD and provide an understanding of the therapeutic action of glucocorticoids in the treatment of Meniere's disease.
16290292	QSAR analysis of meclofenamic acid analogues as selective COX-2 inhibitors.	The use of quantitative structure-activity relationships, since its advent, has become increasingly helpful in understanding many aspects of biochemical interactions in drug research. This approach was utilized to explain the relationship of structure with biological activity of selective COX-2 inhibitors. The enormity of the COX-2 discovery is reflected in the unprecedented speed at which research laboratories have sought to validate its clinical implications. Presented herein is a series of 21 derivatives of meclofenamic acid with selective COX-2 inhibitory activity. Several statistically significant regression expressions were obtained for both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition using sequential multiple linear regression analysis method. Two of these models were selected and validated further, which revealed the importance of Kier molecular flexibility index for COX-2 inhibitory activity and the number of hydrogen bond donor atoms for COX-1 inhibitory activity. Additionally, linear correlation of molecular flexibility with COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities revealed that flexibility of molecules at COX-2 active site can improve the selectivity of COX-2 inhibitors.
16297435	Association with the cholinergic precursor choline alphoscerate and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine: an approach for enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission.	The effects of association of cholinergic precursors choline or choline alphoscerate with the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine on acetylcholine levels and [(3)H]hemicholinium-3 binding were assessed in rat frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Acetylcholine immunoreactivity was also evaluated in cerebrocortical cholinergic fibers by immunohistochemistry. Choline alphoscerate or rivastigmine, but not choline increased acetylcholine levels as well as [(3)H]hemicholinium-3 binding used as a marker of high affinity cholinergic transporter. The association of choline alphoscerate with rivastigmine dose-dependently increased both acetylcholine levels and [(3)H]hemicholinium-3 binding. Rivastigmine alone or in association with either choline or choline alphoscerate decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whereas choline or choline alphoscerate alone did not affect AChE activity. Choline alphoscerate or rivastigmine alone or in association, but not choline increased acetylcholine immunoreactivity in nerve fibers supplying cerebral cortex. These data suggest that combination of a suitable precursor of brain acetylcholine such as choline alphoscerate and of a cholinesterase inhibitor may represent an association worthwhile of being further investigated as a cholinergic replacement therapy in pathologies characterized by altered cholinergic neurotransmission.
16300395	Molecular mechanism of inhibition of nonclassical FGF-1 export.	Fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) lacks a signal sequence and is exported by an unconventional release mechanism. The nonclassical export of FGF-1 has been shown to be inhibited by an anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory drug, amlexanox (AMX). We investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the inhibitory action of AMX on the release of FGF-1, using a variety of biophysical techniques including multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. AMX binds to FGF-1 and enhances its conformational stability. AMX binds to locations close to Cys30 and sterically blocks Cu(2+)-induced oxidation, leading to the formation of the homodimer of FGF-1. AMX-induced inhibition of the formation of the FGF-1 homodimer is observed both under cell-free conditions and in living cells. Results of this study suggest a novel approach for the design of drugs against FGF-1-mediated disorders.
16300628	Evidence that serotonin reuptake modulators increase the density of serotonin innervation in the forebrain.	The mechanism of action of commonly used antidepressants remains an issue of debate. In the experiments reported here we studied the effects of three representative compounds, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, the selective serotonin reuptake enhancer tianeptine and the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine on the structure of central serotonin pathways after a 4-week administration. We found that the serotonin modulators fluoxetine and tianeptine, but not desipramine, increase the density of 5-HT and serotonin transporter (SERT)-immunoreactive axons in the neocortical layer IV and certain forebrain limbic areas, such as piriform cortex and the shell region of nucleus accumbens. These changes were noted in the absence of a significant effect of serotonin antidepressants on the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-2), i.e. the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis and of SERT at the mRNA level. In addition, we found that anterogradely filled terminal axons from injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the dorsal raphe showed significantly more branching in animals treated with fluoxetine compared with animals treated with liposyn vehicle. Our findings suggest that antidepressants may exert very selective structural effects on their cognate monoamine systems in normal animals and raise the possibility that neurotrophic mechanisms may play a role in their clinical efficacy.
16306443	Antihypertensive effects of the putative T-type calcium channel antagonist mibefradil are mediated by the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2.	The role of T-type Ca2+ channels for cardiovascular physiology, in particular blood pressure regulation, is controversial. Selective blockade of T-type Ca2+ channels in resistance arteries has been proposed to explain the effect of the antihypertensive drug mibefradil. In the present study, we used a third generation, time- and tissue-specific conditional knockout model of the L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 (Cav1.2SMAKO mice) to genetically dissect the effects of mibefradil on T- and L-type Ca2+ channels. Myogenic tone and phenylephrine-induced contraction in hindlimb perfusion experiments were sensitive to mibefradil in control mice, whereas the drug showed no effect in Cav1.2-deficient animals. Mean arterial blood pressure in awake, freely moving control mice was reduced by 38+/-2.5 mm Hg at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg bodyweight mibefradil, but not changed in Cav1.2SMAKO mice. These results demonstrate that the effect of the putative T-type Ca2+ channel-selective blocker mibefradil on blood pressure and small vessel myogenic tone is mediated by the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel.
16313925	Preferential inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 4 by ibudilast.	Ibudilast ophthalmic solution exhibited an improved clinical efficacy over cromoglycate in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. To further characterize its principal mode of action, the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitory profile of ibudilast has been examined using human recombinant enzymes. Ibudilast, but not the other commonly used anti-allergic ophthalmic solutions including cromoglycate, ketotifen, tranilast and levocabastine, potently inhibits purified human PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D with IC50 values at 54, 65, 239 and 166 nM, respectively. Ibudilast effectively blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha, IC50 = 6.2 microM) and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced leukotriene (LT) B4 biosynthesis (IC50 = 2.5 microM) in human whole blood, which are 3 and 6-fold more potent than cilomilast, respectively. The attenuated inflammatory and allergic responses from the potent and preferential PDE4 inhibition of ibudilast may have contributed significantly to its beneficial pharmacological responses and distinguishes ibudilast from the other ophthalmic solutions in the treatment of ocular allergy.
16314852	Comparison of HERG channel blocking effects of various beta-blockers-- implication for clinical strategy.	beta-Blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, their effects on HERG channels at comparable conditions remain to be defined. We investigated the direct acute effects of beta-blockers on HERG current and the molecular basis of drug binding to HERG channels with mutations of putative common binding site (Y652A and F656C). beta-Blockers were selected based on the receptor subtype. Wild-type, Y652A and F656C mutants of HERG channel were stably expressed in HEK293 cells, and the current was recorded by using whole-cell patch-clamp technique (23 degrees C). Carvedilol (nonselective), propranolol (nonselective) and ICI 118551 (beta(2)-selective) inhibited HERG current in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) 0.51, 3.9 and 9.2 microM, respectively). The IC(50) value for carvedilol was a clinically relevant concentration. High metoprolol (beta(1)-selective) concentrations were required for blockade (IC(50) 145 microM), and atenolol (beta(1)-selective) did not inhibit the HERG current. Inhibition of HERG current by carvedilol, propranolol and ICI 118551 was partially but significantly attenuated in Y652A and F656C mutant channels. Affinities of metoprolol to Y652A and F656C mutant channels were not different compared with the wild-type. HERG current block by all beta-blockers was not frequency-dependent. Drug affinities to HERG channels were different in beta-blockers. Our results provide additional strategies for clinical usage of beta-blockers. Atenolol and metoprolol may be preferable for patients with type 1 and 2 long QT syndrome. Carvedilol has a class III antiarrhythmic effect, which may provide the rationale for a favourable clinical outcome compared with other beta-blockers as suggested in the recent COMET (Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial) substudy.
16315032	Polymorphisms of genes CYP2D6, ADRB1 and GNAS1 in pharmacokinetics and systemic effects of ophthalmic timolol. A pilot study.	To test the hypotheses that (1) CYP2D6 genotype is associated with pharmacokinetics of ophthalmic timolol and (2) variation in genotypes of ADRB1 (beta(1)-adrenoceptor) and GNAS1 (alpha-subunit of G-protein) modulate heart rate (HR), and systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure responses to timolol.
16319075	Calcium-permeable acid-sensing ion channel is a molecular target of the neurotoxic metal ion lead.	Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are emerging as fundamental players in the regulation of neural plasticity and in pathological conditions. Here we showed that lead (Pb2+), a well known neurotoxic metal ion, reversibly and concentration-dependently inhibited ASIC currents in the acutely dissociated spinal dorsal horn and hippocampal CA1 neurons of rats. In vitro expression of ASIC subunits in combination demonstrated that both ASIC1 and -3 subunits were sensitive to Pb2+. Mechanistically, Pb2+ reduced the pH sensitivity of ASICs independent of membrane voltage change. Moreover, Pb2+ inhibited the ASIC-mediated membrane depolarization and the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In addition, we compared the effect of Pb2+ with that of Ca2+ or amiloride to explore the possible interactions of Pb2+ and Ca2+ in regulating ASICs, and we found that Pb2+ inhibited ASIC currents independent of the amiloride/Ca2+ blockade. Because ASIC1b and -3 subunits are mainly expressed in peripheral neurons, our data identified ASIC1a-containing Ca2+-permeable ASIC as a novel central target of Pb2+ action, which may contribute to Pb2+ neurotoxicity.
16333859	Investigation of mechanism of desmopressin binding in vasopressin V2 receptor versus vasopressin V1a and oxytocin receptors: molecular dynamics simulation of the agonist-bound state in the membrane-aqueous system.	The vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) belongs to the Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). V2R is expressed in the renal collecting duct (CD), where it mediates the antidiuretic action of the neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (CYFQNCPRG-NH2, AVP). Desmopressin ([1-deamino, 8-D]AVP, dDAVP) is strong selective V2R agonist with negligible pressor and uterotonic activity. In this paper, the interactions responsible for binding of dDAVP to vasopressin V2 receptor versus vasopressin V1a and oxytocin receptors has been examined. Three-dimensional activated models of the receptors were constructed using the multiple sequence alignment and the complex of activated rhodopsin with Gt(alpha) C-terminal peptide of transducin MII-Gt(alpha) (338-350) prototype (Slusarz, R.; Ciarkowski, J. Acta Biochim Pol 2004 51, 129-136) as a template. The 1-ns unconstrained molecular dynamics (MD) of receptor-dDAVP complexes immersed in the fully hydrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membrane model was conducted in an Amber 7.0 force field. Highly conserved transmembrane residues have been proposed as being responsible for V2R activation and G protein coupling. Molecular mechanism of the dDAVP binding has been suggested. The internal water molecules involved in an intricate network of the hydrogen bonds inside the receptor cavity have been identified and their role in the stabilization of the agonist-bound state proposed.
16335785	Bosentan, the mixed ETA-ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, attenuated oxidative stress after experimental myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.	Endothelin-1 has been shown to be associated with greater myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in which oxidative stress plays a key role. The efficacy of bosentan, a mixed ETA-ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, in protecting the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress was studied in open-chest Wistar rats. Anesthetized adult male rats (175-250 g b wt) underwent sham operation (SHAM group) or were subjected to 40 min of myocardial ischemia (MI) induced by temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by 2 h reperfusion (R). Rats submitted to the MI-R protocol were administered bosentan at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.v. 20 min (BOS group) or saline (CON group) 20 min post-occlusion of LAD. After the 2 h reperfusion period the animals were euthanized and the heart rapidly excised. Cardiac tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical assay and were fixed in 10% formalin solution for histologic evaluation. Myocardial I-R resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the myocardial malondialdehyde levels and a decrease (p < 0.01) in the myocardial reduced glutathione content. These changes were associated with significant decreases in the myocardial activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (p < 0.05) and catalase (p < 0.01) and severe tissue damage in the jeopardized myocardium in the CON group as compared with the non-myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (NMI-R) SHAM group. Bosentan exerted marked tissue protective effect as assessed by histologic evaluation of the myocardium. The drug significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated myocardial oxidative stress and restored the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms as compared with the saline-treated controls subjected to the MI-R protocol. Furthermore, bosentan also exerted a marked effect on peripheral hemodynamics and heart rate during the reperfusion phase (data reported elsewhere). These results are consistent with the concept that endothelin-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia and infarction. This study demonstrates the antioxidant effect of non-selective endothelin receptor antagonism elucidating that, part of the aetiology of ischemia and reperfusion induced myocardial injury involves impaired antioxidant defenses.
16336943	Distinct functional profiles of aripiprazole and olanzapine at RNA edited human 5-HT2C receptor isoforms.	In this study we have functionally characterized aripiprazole (OPC-14597; 7-(4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy-3,4-dihydro-2-(1H)-quinolinone), the prototype of a new generation antipsychotic drug termed dopamine-serotonin-system stabilizer, in cells expressing 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptor subtypes in comparison with olanzapine. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing 5-HT2 receptors, aripiprazole displayed a dual agonist/antagonist profile for 5-HT2C receptor (VNI isoform) mediated calcium signaling (EC50 1070 nM, IC50 281 nM). It exhibited no appreciable 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B agonism, whereas it antagonized 5-HT-stimulated calcium increase at either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptor expressed in CHO cells (IC50s of 369 and 0.46 nM, respectively). In comparison, olanzapine was devoid of agonism but was an antagonist at all three subtypes, with a potency rank order of 5-HT2A (IC50, 2.5 nM)>5-HT2B (47 nM)>5-HT2C (69 nM). In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transiently expressing 5-HT2C receptor isoforms, aripiprazole exhibited full agonism at the unedited INI, but partial agonism at the partially edited VNI and fully edited VSV isoforms (EC50s of 571, 1086 and 2099 nM, respectively). A partial antagonism was also observed for aripiprazole at the two edited isoforms (IC50s of 1138 and 1000 nM, respectively). In contrast, while lacking agonist activity at the VNI and VSV, olanzapine showed inverse agonism at the INI isoform (IC50 594 nM), reaching a maximal attenuation of 20%. In addition, olanzapine was a full antagonist at all three isoforms, with a rank order of potency of VNI (IC50, 79 nM)>VSV (101 nM)>INI (3856 nM). The modest 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT2C partial agonism, along with reported D2 and 5-HT1A partial agonism, may allow aripiprazole to stabilize the disturbed dopamine-serotonin interplay in schizophrenia with a moderate yet adequate pharmacological intervention. 5-HT2C agonism may also underlie the minimal weight gain seen with aripiprazole.
16339527	Retinoid x receptor agonists increase bcl2a1 expression and decrease apoptosis of naive T lymphocytes.	Vitamin A affects many aspects of T lymphocyte development and function. The vitamin A metabolites all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid regulate gene expression by binding to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), while 9-cis-retinoic acid also binds to the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Naive DO11.10 T lymphocytes expressed mRNA and protein for RAR-alpha, RXR-alpha, and RXR-beta. DNA microarray analysis was used to identify RXR-responsive genes in naive DO11.10 T lymphocytes treated with the RXR agonist AGN194204. A total of 128 genes was differentially expressed, including 16 (15%) involved in cell growth or apoptosis. Among these was Bcl2a1, an antiapoptotic Bcl2 family member. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed this finding and demonstrated that Bcl2a1 mRNA expression was significantly greater in nonapoptotic than in apoptotic T lymphocytes. The RXR agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid also increased Bcl2a1 expression, although all-trans-retinoic acid and ligands for other RXR partner receptors did not. Treatment with AGN194204 and 9-cis-retinoic acid significantly decreased apoptosis measured by annexin V staining but did not affect expression of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL. Bcl2a1 promoter activity was examined using a luciferase promoter construct. Both AGN194204 and 9-cis-retinoic acid significantly increased luciferase activity. In summary, these data demonstrate that RXR agonists increase Bcl2a1 promoter activity and increase expression of Bcl2a1 in naive T lymphocytes but do not affect Bcl2 and Bcl-xL expression in naive T lymphocytes. Thus, this effect on Bcl2a1 expression may account for the decreased apoptosis seen in naive T lymphocytes treated with RXR agonists.
16362726	Positive regulation of hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) activities by soy isoflavones and L-carnitine.	Genistein increases CPT1A, a rate-limiting enzyme in the beta-oxidation pathway, enzyme activity by increasing CPT1A transcription in HepG2 cells and, consequently, suppresses high fat induced obesity in C57BL/6J mice. Genistein and daidzein are the most abundant isoflavones in soy.
16396637	Hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B production are increased following in vivo induction of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase.	We have previously reported a positive correlation between the expression of BHMT (betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase) and ApoB (apolipoprotein B) in rat hepatoma McA (McArdle RH-7777) cells [Sowden, Collins, Smith, Garrow, Sparks and Sparks (1999) Biochem. J. 341, 639-645]. To examine whether a similar relationship occurs in vivo, hepatic BHMT expression was induced by feeding rats a Met (L-methionine)-restricted betaine-containing diet, and parameters of ApoB metabolism were evaluated. There were no generalized metabolic abnormalities associated with Met restriction for 7 days, as evidenced by control levels of serum glucose, ketones, alanine aminotransferase and L-homocysteine levels. Betaine plus the Met restriction resulted in lower serum insulin and non-esterified fatty acid levels. Betaine plus Met restriction induced hepatic BHMT 4-fold and ApoB mRNA 3-fold compared with Met restriction alone. No changes in percentage of edited ApoB mRNA were observed on the test diets. An increase in liver ApoB mRNA correlated with an 82% and 46% increase in ApoB and triacylglycerol production respectively using in vivo Triton WR 1339. Increased secretion of VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) with Met restriction plus betaine was associated with a 45% reduction in liver triacylglycerol compared with control. Nuclear run-off assays established that transcription of both bhmt and apob genes was also increased in Met-restricted plus betaine diets. No change in ApoB mRNA stability was detected in BHMT-transfected McA cells. Hepatic ApoB and BHMT mRNA levels were also increased by 1.8- and 3-fold respectively by betaine supplementation of Met-replete diets. Since dietary betaine increased ApoB mRNA, VLDL ApoB and triacylglycerol production and decreased hepatic triacylglycerol, results suggest that induction of apob transcription may provide a potential mechanism for mobilizing hepatic triacylglycerol by increasing ApoB available for VLDL assembly and secretion.
16397263	Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor, inhibits the kinase activity of wild-type, juxtamembrane, and activation loop mutant KIT isoforms associated with human malignancies.	Activating mutations of the activation loop of KIT are associated with certain human neoplasms, including the majority of patients with systemic mast cell disorders, as well as cases of seminoma, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of wild-type (WT) KIT and certain mutant KIT isoforms and has become the standard of care for treating patients with metastatic GIST. However, KIT activation loop mutations involving codon D816 that are typically found in AML, systemic mastocytosis, and seminoma are insensitive to imatinib mesylate (IC50 > 5-10 micromol/L), and acquired KIT activation loop mutations can be associated with imatinib mesylate resistance in GIST. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825) is a small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of SRC and ABL tyrosine kinases with potency in the low nanomolar range. Some small-molecule SRC/ABL inhibitors also have potency against WT KIT kinase. Therefore, we hypothesized that dasatinib might inhibit the kinase activity of both WT and mutant KIT isoforms. We report herein that dasatinib potently inhibits WT KIT and juxtamembrane domain mutant KIT autophosphorylation and KIT-dependent activation of downstream pathways important for cell viability and cell survival, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription. Furthermore, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant KIT activation loop mutants and induces apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations (potency against KIT D816Y > D816F > D816V). Our studies suggest that dasatinib may have clinical efficacy against human neoplasms that are associated with gain-of-function KIT mutations.
16398929	Human physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for ACE inhibitors: ramipril and ramiprilat.	The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have complicated and poorly characterized pharmacokinetics. There are two binding sites per ACE (high affinity "C", lower affinity "N") that have sub-nanomolar affinities and dissociation rates of hours. Most inhibitors are given orally in a prodrug form that is systemically converted to the active form. This paper describes the first human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of this drug class.
16407246	Fyn is required for haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice.	Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits has been implicated in various brain functions, including ethanol tolerance, learning, and seizure susceptibility. In this study, we explored the role of Fyn in haloperidol-induced catalepsy, an animal model of the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics. Haloperidol induced catalepsy and muscle rigidity in the control mice, but these responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Expression of the striatal dopamine D(2) receptor, the main site of haloperidol action, did not differ between the two genotypes. Fyn activation and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, as measured by Western blotting, were induced after haloperidol injection of the control mice, but both responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Dopamine D(2) receptor blockade was shown to increase both NR2B phosphorylation and the NMDA-induced calcium responses in control cultured striatal neurons but not in Fyn-deficient neurons. Based on these findings, we proposed a new molecular mechanism underlying haloperidol-induced catalepsy, in which the dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist induces striatal Fyn activation and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B alters striatal neuronal activity, thereby inducing the behavioral changes that are manifested as a cataleptic response.
16426349	The effects of pentoxifylline on the myocardial inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury during cardiopulmonary bypass.	Pentoxifylline (Ptx) decreases necessity of cell energy and inflammatory reactions via inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT). The aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of Ptx into the cardioplegic solutions avoids myocardial inflammatory reactions and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury during extracorpereal circulation.
16427816	The role of lysine residues 297 and 306 in nucleoside triphosphate regulation of E. coli CTP synthase: inactivation by 2',3'-dialdehyde ATP and mutational analyses.	Cytidine 5'-triphosphate synthase (CTPS) catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of CTP from UTP using either NH3 or L-glutamine as the source of nitrogen. To identify the location of the ATP-binding site within the primary structure of E. coli CTPS, we used the affinity label 2',3'-dialdehyde adenosine 5'-triphosphate (oATP). oATP irreversibly inactivated CTPS in a first-order, time-dependent manner while ATP protected the enzyme from inactivation. In the presence of 10 mM UTP, the values of k(inact) and K(I) were 0.054 +/- 0.001 min(-1) and 3.36 +/- 0.02 mM, respectively. CTPS was labeled using (2,8-3H)oATP and subsequently subjected to trypsin-catalyzed proteolysis. The tryptic peptides were separated using reversed-phase HPLC, and two peptides were identified using N-terminal sequencing (S(492)GDDQLVEIIEVPNH(506) and Y(298)IELPDAY(K(306)) in a 5:1 ratio). The latter suggested that Lys 306 had been modified by oATP. Replacement of Lys 306 by alanine reduced the rate of oATP-dependent inactivation (k(inact) = 0.0058 +/- 0.0005 min(-1), K(I) = 3.7 +/- 1.3 mM) and reduced the apparent affinity of CTPS for both ATP and UTP by approximately 2-fold. The efficiency of K306A-catalyzed glutamine-dependent CTP formation was also reduced 2-fold while near wild-type activity was observed when NH3 was the substrate. These findings suggest that Lys 306 is not essential for ATP binding, but does play a role in bringing about the conformational changes that mediate interactions between the ATP and UTP sites, and between the ATP-binding site and the glutamine amide transfer domain. Replacement of the nearby, fully conserved Lys 297 by alanine did not affect NH3-dependent CTP formation, relative to wild-type CTPS, but reduced k(cat) for the glutaminase activity 78-fold. Our findings suggest that the conformational change associated with binding ATP may be transmitted through the L10-alpha11 structural unit (residues 297-312) and thereby mediate effects on the glutaminase activity of CTPS.
16434140	Solubilization and immunopurification of rat brain synaptic vesicle protein 2A with maintained binding properties.	This study reports the solubilization of the rat synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, the brain binding site for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV), and its characterization. N-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (DDM) was the best detergent at achieving a high percentage of SV2A solubilization and at maintaining the binding characteristics of a tritiated form of a more potent analogue of LEV, [3H]ucb 30889 ((2S)-2-[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]butanamide). Scatchard analysis revealed that approximately 25% of SV2A proteins from brain membranes are solubilized by DDM under optimal conditions. Competition binding experiments with a variety of LEV analogues indicated that [3H]ucb 30889 labels the same binding site in both crude homogenates and soluble extracts, with still high stereoselectivity. After immunoprecipitation of SV2A from solubilized rat brain membranes, binding properties of [3H]ucb 30889 to SV2A and association with synaptotagmin I were maintained. The two other isoforms SV2B and SV2C were found to be co-immunoprecipitated with SV2A. The solubilization and immunopurification of SV2A with unmodified ligand affinities and synaptotagmin I interaction provides the starting point for future protein-protein interactions and structural studies.
16436705	Discovery of FabH/FabF inhibitors from natural products.	Condensing enzymes are essential in type II fatty acid synthesis and are promising targets for antibacterial drug discovery. Recently, a new approach using a xylose-inducible plasmid to express antisense RNA in Staphylococcus aureus has been described; however, the actual mechanism was not delineated. In this paper, the mechanism of decreased target protein production by expression of antisense RNA was investigated using Northern blotting. This revealed that the antisense RNA acts posttranscriptionally by targeting mRNA, leading to 5' mRNA degradation. Using this technology, a two-plate assay was developed in order to identify FabF/FabH target-specific cell-permeable inhibitors by screening of natural product extracts. Over 250,000 natural product fermentation broths were screened and then confirmed in biochemical assays, yielding a hit rate of 0.1%. All known natural product FabH and FabF inhibitors, including cerulenin, thiolactomycin, thiotetromycin, and Tü3010, were discovered using this whole-cell mechanism-based screening approach. Phomallenic acids, which are new inhibitors of FabF, were also discovered. These new inhibitors exhibited target selectivity in the gel elongation assay and in the whole-cell-based two-plate assay. Phomallenic acid C showed good antibacterial activity, about 20-fold better than that of thiolactomycin and cerulenin, against S. aureus. It exhibited a spectrum of antibacterial activity against clinically important pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae.
16449525	Imatinib as a potential antiresorptive therapy for bone disease.	Osteoclasts (OCs) are large multinucleated cells derived from progenitor cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Signal transduction via the macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, c-fms, is essential for OC formation. Since we have previously demonstrated inhibition of c-fms by imatinib, we examined the effect of imatinib on OC formation and activity. OC formation was not affected by concentrations of 1.0 microM imatinib and lower, but was reduced by 75% at 3.0 microM imatinib. In contrast, both the area of resorption and the number of resorption lacunae were reduced by 80% at 0.3 microM imatinib, and no resorption was observed at concentrations above 3.0 microM. A dose-dependent decrease in receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (RANK) expression was observed in OCs when cultured in the presence of imatinib, providing a mechanism for the decrease in OC function. In vivo analysis of the effect of imatinib on OC activity in adult mice following 8 weeks of imatinib treatment also demonstrated a decrease in OC activity. These results suggest that imatinib may have therapeutic value as an antiosteolytic agent in diseases such as osteoporosis, metastatic bone disease, and multiple myeloma.
16452989	Loss of serotonin transporter protein after MDMA and other ring-substituted amphetamines.	We studied in vivo expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), or fenfluramine (FEN) treatments, and compared the effects of substituted amphetamines to those of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), an established serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. All drug treatments produced lasting reductions in 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and [(3)H]paroxetine binding, but no significant change in the density of a 70 kDa band initially thought to correspond to the SERT protein. Additional Western blot studies, however, showed that the 70 kDa band did not correspond to the SERT protein, and that a diffuse band at 63-68 kDa, one that had the anticipated regional brain distribution of SERT protein (midbrain>striatum>neocortex>cerebellum), was reduced after 5,7-DHT and was absent in SERT-null animals, was decreased after MDMA, PCA, or FEN treatments. In situ immunocytochemical (ICC) studies with the same two SERT antisera used in Western blot studies showed loss of SERT-immunoreactive (IR) axons after 5,7-DHT and MDMA treatments. In the same animals, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)-IR axon density was comparably reduced, indicating that serotonergic deficits after substituted amphetamines differ from those in SERT-null animals, which have normal TPH levels but, in the absence of SERT, develop apparent neuroadaptive changes in 5-HT metabolism. Together, these results suggest that lasting serotonergic deficits after MDMA and related drugs are unlikely to represent neuroadaptive metabolic responses to changes in SERT trafficking, and favor the view that substituted amphetamines have the potential to produce a distal axotomy of brain 5-HT neurons.
16456024	TNF-alpha blockade down-regulates the CD40/CD40L pathway in the mucosal microcirculation: a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of infliximab in Crohn's disease.	The CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) pathway is involved in Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. In the patients' circulation, soluble CD40L (sCD40L) levels are elevated and surface CD40L is increased in platelets and T cells, whereas in the intestine CD40 is overexpressed in the microvasculature and CD40L in platelets and T cells. The therapeutic effects of infliximab in CD are attributed to its systemic anti-TNF-alpha action, but because TNF-alpha modulates both CD40 and CD40L, we investigated whether infliximab affects the CD40/CD40L pathway in the intestine. Eighteen CD patients were evaluated before and after infliximab therapy. Plasma sCD40L was measured by ELISA and platelet and peripheral blood T cell (PBT) CD40L expression by flow cytometry. Microvascular CD40 and VCAM-1 expression were assessed in mucosal biopsies by immunohistochemistry and by flow cytometry in human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC). Cell cultures were performed in the presence and absence of infliximab. Infliximab treatment significantly reduced plasma sCD40L levels and eliminated CD40 and VCAM-1 from mucosal microvessels. In vitro infliximab prevented TNF-alpha-induced CD40 and VCAM-1 expression by HIMEC, and reduced PBT, but not platelet, surface CD40L expression and sCD40L release. In addition, infliximab decreased T cell-induced VCAM-1 expression in HIMEC by down-regulating CD40L in T cells and promoting T cells apoptosis. These findings point to a novel mechanism of action of infliximab, i.e., the disruption of CD40/CD40L-dependent cognate interactions between intestinal microvessels and T cells. Thus, in addition to neutralizing TNF-alpha and inducing T cell death, the therapeutic effects of infliximab in CD appear to be also mediated by inhibition of vascular inflammation in the gut.
16460947	Comparative structure-activity relationships of benztropine analogues at the dopamine transporter and histamine H(1) receptors.	Benztropine (BZT) and its analogues inhibit dopamine uptake and bind with moderate to high affinity to the dopamine transporter (DAT). However, many of these compounds, in contrast to other monoamine uptake inhibitors, lack cocaine-like behavioral effects and fail to potentiate the effects of cocaine. The BZT analogues also exhibit varied binding affinities for muscarinic M(1) and histamine H(1) receptors. In this study, a comparative analysis was conducted of pharmacophoric features with respect to the activities of BZT analogues at the DAT and at the histamine H(1) receptor. The BZT analogues showed a wide range of histamine H(1) receptor (K(i)=16-37,600 nM) and DAT (K(i)=8.5-6370 nM) binding affinities. A stereoselective histamine H(1)-antagonist pharmacophore, using a five-point superimposition of classical antagonists on the template, cyproheptadine, was developed. A series of superimpositions and comparisons were performed with various analogues of BZT. In general, smaller substituents were well tolerated on the aromatic rings of the diphenyl methoxy group for both the DAT and H(1) receptor, however, for the H(1) receptor, substitution at only one of the aromatic rings was preferred. The substituents at the 2- and N-positions of the tropane ring were preferred for DAT, however, these groups seem to overlap receptor essential regions in the histamine H(1) receptor. Molecular models at the DAT and the histamine H(1) receptor provide further insight into the structural requirements for binding affinity and selectivity that can be implemented in future drug design.
1646776	5-Hydroxtryptamine1D receptor agonism predicts antimigraine efficacy.	The interactions of four abortive anti-migraine agents and four prophylactic anti-migraine agents with 5-HT1D receptors in bovine brain were analyzed using radioligand binding techniques and adenylate cyclase assays. In bovine caudate, the affinities of abortive anti-migraine agents (i.e. 5-hydroxytryptamine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan) for 5-HT1D receptors range from 4.0-34 nM while the affinities of prophylactic anti-migraine agents (i.e. methysergide, amitriptyline, (-)propranolol, verapamil) range from 46-11,000 nM. In adenylate cyclase studies in bovine substantia nigra, all four abortive anti-migraine agents dose-dependently inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, a biochemical effect mediated by 5-HT1D receptors. No agonist effect on cyclase activity is observed with the four prophylactic anti-migraine agents. These data support the hypothesis that abortive anti-migraine agents are 5-HT1D receptor agonists and that this effect may underlie their anti-migraine efficacy.
16467980	Bilateral adrenalectomy for ectopic Cushing's syndrome-discussions on technique and indication.	Tumors producing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) often remain undiagnosed until severe Cushing's syndrome appears, and it may be difficult to distinguish from Cushing's syndrome due to pituitary tumors. Many patients suffer from disease spread, with metastases in the liver or other locations, and the main symptoms may be mineral disturbances, diabetes mellitus, or psychological symptoms from the severe hypercortisolism. Bilateral adrenalectomy may alleviate this situation, but is sometimes a troublesome procedure in these severely ill patients.
16495076	The 5-HT2B antagonist and 5-HT4 agonist activities of tegaserod in the anaesthetized rat.	The 5-HT4 receptor agonist and gastroprokinetic, tegaserod, possesses 5-HT2B receptor antagonist activity. However, the relevance of such activity is unclear. In this study, the 5-HT2B receptor antagonist and 5-HT4 agonist activities of tegaserod were investigated. Two piezoelectric crystals were implanted on the stomach fundus or oesophagus of anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Measurement of the transmission time of ultrasonic pulses between the implanted crystals provided a continuous record of inter-crystal distance, and thus of muscle length. In the stomach fundus, tegaserod (1 and 3 mg kg(-1)), administered subcutaneously (s.c.), inhibited the contractile response evoked by the 5-HT2B receptor agonist, BW 723C86 (0.01-1 mg kg(-1) intravenously (i.v.)). SB 206553 (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.), a selective 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist, also inhibited the BW 723C86-mediated responses. In the rat oesophagus, tegaserod (0.001-0.3 mg kg(-1) i.v. or 0.003-3 mg kg(-1) s.c.) increased inter-crystal distance, consistent with smooth muscle relaxation; the responses were inhibited by the 5-HT4 antagonist, piboserod (0.1 mg kg(-1) s.c.). Data from this in vivo rat study are consistent with tegaserod-induced 5-HT4 receptor-mediated oesophageal relaxation, and antagonism of 5-HT2B receptor-mediated stomach fundus contraction. The clinical relevance of the 5-HT2B receptor antagonism of tegaserod remains to be determined.
16503922	Purinergic receptor ligands stimulate pro-opiomelanocortin gene expression in AtT-20 pituitary corticotroph cells.	Although recent studies have suggested that purinergic receptors are expressed in the anterior pituitary gland, their involvement in the regulation of pituitary hormone gene expression is not completely understood. In the present study, we examined the expression of purinergic receptors and the effects of purinergic receptor ligands on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression, in AtT20 mouse corticotroph cells. We identified the expression of most of the purinergic receptor subtypes (A1, A2, P2X1, 3-7, P2Y1, 2, 4) mRNAs, analysed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We also found that adenosine and ATP, two representative and endogenous agonists of A1-3 and P2X/P2Y receptors, respectively, stimulated the 5'-promoter activity of the POMC gene in a dose- and time-related manner. When these ligands were simultaneously used with corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), effects that were more than additive were observed, suggesting an enhancing role of these compounds in CRH-mediated adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) synthesis. These ligands also stimulated the expression of transcription factors involved in the regulation of the POMC gene, but did not enhance ACTH secretion. Finally, the positive effect of adenosine as well as CRH was completely inhibited by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89, whereas that of ATP was not influenced, indicating that different intracellular signalling pathways mediate these effects. Altogether, our results suggest a stimulatory role for these purinergic receptor ligands in the regulation of POMC gene expression in corticotroph cells. Because adenosine and ATP are known to be produced within the pituitary gland, it is possible they may be acting in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.
16505027	Endothelin antagonism: effects of FP receptor agonists prostaglandin F2alpha and fluprostenol on trabecular meshwork contractility.	This study analyzes additional mechanisms behind the ocular hypotensive effect of prostaglandin F (PGF) receptor (FP receptor) agonists PGF2alpha and fluprostenol (fluprostenol-isopropyl ester [travoprost]), which reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma probably by enhancing uveoscleral flow. The trabecular meshwork (TM) is actively involved in IOP regulation through contractile mechanisms. Contractility of TM is induced by endothelin (ET)-1, a possible pathogenic factor in glaucoma. The involvement of FP receptor agonists in the ET-1 effects on TM function was studied.
16505108	Recombinant epoetins do not stimulate tumor growth in erythropoietin receptor-positive breast carcinoma models.	We investigated the significance of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) expression following treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO; epoetin alpha) and the effect of recombinant epoetins (epoetin alpha, epoetin beta, and darbepoetin alpha) alone or in combination with anticancer therapy on tumor growth in two well-established preclinical models of breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines). Expression and localization of EPOR under hypoxic and normoxic conditions in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were evaluated by immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. EPOR binding was evaluated using [125I]rHuEPO. Proliferation, migration, and signaling in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells following treatment with rHuEPO were evaluated. Tumor growth was assessed following administration of recombinant epoetins alone and in combination with paclitaxel (anticancer therapy) in orthotopically implanted MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast carcinoma xenograft models in athymic mice. EPOR expression was detected in both tumor cell lines. EPOR localization was found to be exclusively cytosolic and no specific [125I]rHuEPO binding was observed. There was no stimulated migration, proliferation, or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT following rHuEPO treatment. In mice, treatment with recombinant epoetins alone and in combination with paclitaxel resulted in equivalent tumor burdens compared with vehicle-treated controls. Results from our study suggest that although EPOR expression was observed in two well-established breast carcinoma cell lines, it was localized to a cytosolic distribution and did not transduce a signaling cascade in tumors that leads to tumor growth. The addition of recombinant epoetins to paclitaxel did not affect the outcome of paclitaxel therapy in breast carcinoma xenograft models. These results show that recombinant epoetins do not evoke a physiologic response on EPOR-bearing tumor cells as assessed by numerous variables, including growth, migration, and cytotoxic challenge in preclinical in vivo tumor models.
16513821	Histamine mediates osteoclastic resorption only during the acute phase of bone loss in ovariectomized rats.	Short-term studies have shown that histamine is involved, via its H2 receptors (H2R), in the mediator network regulating trabecular bone loss in long bones of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. It is not known whether this effect of histamine persists over time or involves other skeletal sites. In this study, rats were maintained for 6 months postOVX and treated daily with saline or famotidine (10 mg kg(-1)), an H2R antagonist. At the end of the experimental period, femur trabecular bone mass was markedly decreased in OVX rats, whether or not they were treated with famotidine. In contrast, in the fourth lumbar vertebra, where bone loss starts later than in the femur, famotidine treatment attenuated the decline in trabecular bone volume, protected the trabecular architecture, maintained the thickness of the cortices and reduced the numbers of osteoclasts and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive preosteoclasts, whereas it had no influence on bone formation parameters. In vertebral bone marrow of OVX rats, the numbers of mast cells (MCs) and non-MC histamine-producing cells increased, while famotidine treatment significantly diminished both cell populations. These data show that H2R antagonism does not protect trabecular bone mass in the long term, and that short-term protection involves all bones. Histamine is involved during the early phase of strong osteoclastic resorption but not during the late phase of slower resorption, suggesting that different mediator networks control the two phases of destruction. Histamine would be part of the network mediating the early phase.
1651852	Diazepam binding inhibitor and its processing products stimulate mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis via an interaction with mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors.	A recognition site for benzodiazepines structurally different from that linked to various gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor subtypes is located on the outer mitochondrial membranes of steroidogenic cells. This protein has been signified to be important in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. Because of its location it is designated herein as the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). A putative endogenous ligand for MBR is the peptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), previously shown to displace drugs from MBR and to be expressed and stored in steroidogenic cells rich in MBR. The two model systems used to study steroidogenic regulation by DBI were the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines previously shown to be applicable in studies of mitochondrial steroidogenesis. Both cell lines contain DBI as well as DBI processing products, including the DBI fragments that on reverse phase HPLC coelute with the naturally occurring triakontatetraneuropeptide [TTN; DBI-(17-50)] and octadecaneuropeptide [DBI-(33-50)]. When DBI purified from rat brain was added to mitochondria prepared from Y-1 and MA-10 cell lines, it increased the rates of pregnenolone formation in a dose-related manner. In both cell lines, maximal stimulation (3-fold) of mitochondrial steroidogenesis was obtained with 0.33 microM DBI, with an EC50 of approximately 0.1 microM. However, DBI concentrations higher than 1 microM caused a smaller increase in pregnenolone formation. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds with high nanomolar affinity to MBR, was recently shown to act as an antagonist of ACTH and LH/hCG-induced steroidogenesis and was found in the present studies to inhibit DBI-stimulated mitochondrial steroidogenesis. During the incubation with mitochondria, DBI was partially processed to different peptide fragments, including octadecaneuropeptide and TTN. To determine whether DBI processing products influence mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis, several DBI fragments and other peptides structurally unrelated to DBI were tested. Among these, only TTN stimulated mitochondrial steroid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner similar to DBI.
16518831	AMP-dependent protein kinase alpha 2 isoform promotes hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in human glioblastoma.	Tumor cells respond to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of genes involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and angiogenesis, all essential to maintaining nutrient availability and intracellular ATP levels. Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor for cellular homeostasis and is highly sensitive to changes in AMP:ATP ratios. The two catalytic AMPK alpha isoforms (AMPKalpha1, AMPKalpha2) were investigated with respect to their expression, cellular distribution, and contribution to VEGF expression under hypoxic stress in human U373 glioblastoma cells. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed AMPKalpha1 mRNA to be constitutively expressed in normoxia and hypoxia, whereas AMPKalpha2 mRNA levels were low in normoxia and significantly induced in hypoxia. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed that AMPKalpha2 protein redistributed to the nucleus under hypoxia, whereas AMPKalpha1 remained distributed throughout the cell. The AMPK chemical inhibitor, 5-iodotubericidin, effectively repressed the hypoxic induction of VEGF mRNA levels and hypoxia inducible factor-1 dependent transcription. AMPKalpha2 repression with RNA interference reduced hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA and HIF-1 transcription, whereas AMPKalpha1 repression did not. Human glioblastoma cell lines U118 and U138 also showed hypoxia-induction of AMPKalpha2 as well as VEGF. Immunohistochemistry analysis of human astrocytoma/glioma samples revealed AMPKalpha2 present in high grade gliomas within hypoxic pseudopalisading microenvironments. These data suggest that prolonged hypoxia promotes the expression and functional activation of AMPKalpha2 and VEGF production in glioma cell lines and glioblastoma multiform tumors, thus contributing to tumor survival and angiogenesis in high grade human gliomas.
16519964	Evidence for serum-deprivation-induced co-release of FGF-1 and S100A13 from astrocytes.	Since fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 lacks conventional amino-terminal signal peptide essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway, the mode of release of this polypeptide remains to be fully understood. We attempted to characterize the non-classical (non-vesicular) mode of FGF-1 release in the analyses using immunocytochemistry and immunoblot of conditioned medium (CM) from astrocytes. FGF-1 was completely released from astrocytes upon serum-deprivation stress in a Brefeldin A-insensitive manner. In the immunoprecipitation study using anti-FGF-1 IgG, S100A13 was identified to be the major protein co-eluted with FGF-1. The interaction between GST-FGF-1 and Strep-tag II-S100A13 was found to be Ca(2+)-sensitive, and to require the C-terminal 11 amino acid peptide sequence of S100A13. The overexpression of Delta88-98 mutant of S100A13 selectively inhibited the serum-deprivation stress-induced release of FGF-1, but not the release of S100A13 mutant from C6 glioma cells. However, amlexanox, anti-allergic drug whose target is S100A13, completely inhibited the stress-induced release of FGF-1 as well as S100A13. The stress-induced release of both proteins was also abolished by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agent. The serum-deprivation caused Ca(2+) spikes in omega-conotoxin GVIA and thapsigargin-sensitive manner. All these results suggest that S100A13 is a cargo molecule for the serum-deprivation stress-induced non-classical release of FGF-1, and that its driving force of protein-protein interaction and release is possibly mediated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) coupled to N-type Ca(2+) channel activity.
16523405	Promoter polymorphisms regulating corticotrophin-releasing hormone transcription in vitro.	To investigate whether polymorphisms in the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) promoter are associated with altered CRH gene regulation, we studied the reactivity of three recently described promoter variants in vitro. The 3625 bp variants A1B1, A2B1 and A2B2 of the human CRH promoter were cloned in the 5' region to a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into both mouse anterior pituitary cells AtT-20D16vF2 and pheochromocytoma cells PC12. Incubation with 8-Br-cAMP alone or in combination with cytokines significantly enhanced the promoter activity in both cell lines studied by up to 22-fold. However, dexamethasone antagonised cAMP effects on CRH expression in AtT-20 cells while showing no effect on PC12 cells, indicating that tissue-specific factors play a crucial role. Among the haplotypes studied, A1B1 exhibited the greatest reactivity on various stimuli. Electric mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to study whether the described polymorphic nucleotide sequences in the 5' region of the hCRH gene interfere with binding of nuclear proteins. A specific DNA protein complex was detected at position -2353 bp for the wild type sequence only, possibly interfering with a binding site for the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Taken together, this is the first study to demonstrate that CRH promoter reactivity varies between the compound promoter alleles.
16543605	Cloning and characterization of CYP51 from Mycobacterium avium.	Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) causes chronic lung disease in immunocompetent people and disseminated infection in patients with AIDS. MAC is intrinsically resistant to many conventional antimycobacterial agents, it develops drug resistance rapidly to macrolide antibiotics, and patients with MAC infection experience frequent relapses or the inability to completely eradicate the infection with current treatment. Treatment regimens are prolonged and complicated by drug toxicity or intolerances. We sought to identify biochemical pathways in MAC that can serve as targets for novel antimycobacterial treatment. The cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP51, catalyzes an essential early step in sterol metabolism, removing a methyl group from lanosterol in animals and fungi, or from obtusifoliol in plants. Azoles inhibit CYP51 function, leading to an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This perturbation of normal sterol metabolism compromises cell membrane integrity, resulting in growth inhibition or cell death. We have cloned and characterized a CYP51 from MAC that functions as a lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase. We show the direct interactions of azoles with purified MAC-CYP51 by absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of econazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole against MAC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that econazole has a MIC of 4 mug/ml and a minimum bacteriocidal concentration of 4 mug/ml, whereas ketoconazole has a MIC of 8 mug/ml and a minimum bacteriocidal concentration of 16 mug/ml. Itraconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole did not inhibit MAC growth to any significant extent.
1654566	Structure-activity studies of novel casomorphin analogues: binding profiles towards mu 1-, mu 2- and delta -opioid receptors.	The beta -casomorphin-5 sequence was systematically modified by substitution of the naturally occurring amino acids. The derivatives are compared on the basis of their affinities towards mu 1-, mu 2 and delta -opioid binding sites estimated by means of binding studies with [3H]dihydromorphine and [3H]D-Ala2-Leu5-enkephalin as labels and computer curve fitting. A C-terminal amide group which is known to increase mu-site affinity of beta -CM-4 and beta -CM-5 mainly enhances the mu 2-site affinity. Furthermore, the Pro4-amide structure, which seems to be responsible for the affinity enhancement can be substituted by the pyrrolidide ring structure. Modifications in position 2, 3 and 4 can lead to an increase in mu 1-, mu 2- or delta -site affinity and/or selectivity. The specificity of these effects might be dependent on the respective changes in the charge or hydrophobicity due to the introduction of other amino acids. The results suggest firstly that the alternating proline residues in the beta -CM-5 molecule are not absolutely necessary for its mu-site affinities, and secondly that both opioid receptor subtype affinity and selectivity may be modified by changing charge and/or hydrophobicity in the middle part of the beta -casomorphin molecule.
16545798	Lack of interaction between prostaglandin E2 receptor subtypes in regulating adenylyl cyclase activity in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion cells.	The hyperalgesic response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is thought to be mediated by activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway in primary sensory neurones. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of different PGE2 (EP) receptor subtypes to the overall activity of adenylyl cyclase in adult rat isolated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, in vitro. PGE2 and the prostanoid EP4 receptor agonist ONO-AE1-329 increased [3H]cAMP production with EC50 values of 500 nM and 70 nM, respectively, and showed similar efficacies. No combination of prostanoid EP1, EP2, EP3 or EP4 receptor selective agonists produced synergistic increases in [3H]cAMP. The prostacyclin mimetic cicaprost increased [3H]cAMP production with an EC50 value of 42 nM and produced a significantly greater maximal response compared with PGE2. No evidence for prostanoid EP3 receptor-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity could be obtained to account for the relatively weak effect of PGE2 compared with prostacyclin receptor agonists. Interestingly, sulprostone (prostanoid EP3/EP1 receptor agonist) caused a Rho-kinase-dependent retraction of neurites, suggesting an alternative role for prostanoid EP3 receptors in DRG cells. In conclusion, PGE2 mediated increases in adenylyl cyclase activity in primary sensory neurones is likely to be mediated by activation of prostanoid EP4 receptors, and is not under inhibitory control by prostanoid EP3 receptors.
16551906	The antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on human tongue cancer cells with inhibition of the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor.	Local anesthetics suppress proliferation in several cancer cells. The mechanism of the suppression, however, is unknown. Our previous study shows that lidocaine, at the level of tissue concentration under topical or local administration, has a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a potential target for antiproliferation in cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that lidocaine would suppress the proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of EGFR activity. We investigated the effects of lidocaine (40-4000 microM) on proliferation of a human tongue cancer cell line, CAL27, which has a high level of EGFR expression, and also examined the effect of lidocaine on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated autophosphorylation of EGFR in CAL27 cells. A clinical concentration of lidocaine (400 microM) suppressed both serum-induced and EGF-induced proliferation of CAL27 cells and inhibited EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR without cytotoxicity. A larger concentration of lidocaine (4000 microM) showed cytotoxicity with an antiproliferative effect. We suggest that the inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR activity is one of the mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on CAL27 cells. Lidocaine administered topically within the oral cavity for cancer pain relief may suppress the proliferation of human tongue cancer cells.
16552142	Specific binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to phospholipase A2: structure of the complex formed between phospholipase A2 and diclofenac at 2.7 A resolution.	Type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids. In order to elucidate the role of PLA2 in inflammatory disorders and to determine the mode of binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to PLA2, the detailed three-dimensional structure of a complex formed between a group IIA PLA2 from Daboia russelli pulchella and 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid (diclofenac) has been determined. The preformed complex was crystallized by equilibrating the protein solution against a mixture of 0.20 M ammonium sulfate and 30% PEG 4000. The crystals belong to space group P4(3), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 53.0, c = 48.4 A. The structure was solved by the molecular-replacement method and refined to R(cryst) and R(free) factors of 0.192 and 0.211, respectively, using reflections to 2.7 A resolution. The structure showed that diclofenac occupies a very favourable position in the centre of the substrate-binding hydrophobic channel that allows a number of intermolecular interactions. The binding mode of diclofenac involved crucial interactions with important residues for substrate recognition such as Asp49, His48 and Gly30. In addition, it included three new interactions involving its Cl atoms with Phe5, Ala18 and Tyr22. It also showed an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions involving almost all of the residues of the substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. The binding affinity of diclofenac was determined using surface plasmon resonance, which gave an equilibrium constant of 4.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8) M.
16554486	Contributions of the GABAA receptor alpha6 subunit to phasic and tonic inhibition revealed by a naturally occurring polymorphism in the alpha6 gene.	GABAA receptors (GABARs) are heteromultimeric proteins composed of five subunits. The specific subunit composition determines critical properties of a GABAR such as pharmacological sensitivities and whether the receptor contributes to synaptic or extrasynaptic forms of inhibition. Classically, synaptic but not extrasynaptic GABARs are thought to respond to benzodiazepines, whereas the reverse has been suggested for ethanol. To examine the effects of subunit composition on GABAR function in situ, we took advantage of two naturally occurring alleles of the rat gene for GABAR subunit alpha6 (Gabra6(100R) and Gabra6(100Q)). Depending on their subunit partners, these two variants of alpha6 can lead to differential sensitivities to benzodiazepines and ethanol. An examination of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA-mediated currents in cerebellar granule cells from Gabra6(100R/100R) and Gabra6(100Q/100Q) rats uncovered marked allele-dependent differences in benzodiazepine sensitivity. Unexpectedly, we found that the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and diazepam enhanced extrasynaptic inhibition mediated by delta subunit-containing GABARs in Gabra6(100Q/100Q) rats. Complementary experiments on recombinant GABARs confirmed that, at subsaturating [GABA], flunitrazepam potentiates alpha6/delta subunit-containing GABARs. Based on data and a simple theoretical analysis, we estimate that the average extrasynaptic [GABA] is approximately 160 nm in perfused slices. These results (1) demonstrate contributions of alpha6 subunits to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA responses, (2) establish that delta subunit-containing GABARs are benzodiazepine sensitive at subsaturating [GABA] and, (3) provide an empirical estimate of extrasynaptic [GABA] in slices.
16556440	Binding characteristics of levetiracetam to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in human brain and in CHO cells expressing the human recombinant protein.	A specific binding site for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (2S-(oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide, Keppra) in rat brain, referred to as the levetiracetam binding site, was discovered several years ago. More recently, this binding site has been identified as the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a protein present in synaptic vesicles [Lynch, B., Lambeng, N., Nocka, K., Kensel-Hammes, P., Bajjalieh, S.M., Matagne, A., Fuks, B., 2004. The synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 101, 9861-9866.]. In this study, we characterized the binding properties of levetiracetam in post-mortem human brain and compared them to human SV2A expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The results showed that the binding properties of levetiracetam and [3H]ucb 30889, an analogue that was previously characterized as a suitable ligand for levetiracetam binding site/SV2A in rat brain [Gillard, M., Fuks, B., Michel, P., Vertongen, P., Massingham, R. Chatelain, P., 2003. Binding characteristics of [3H]ucb 30889 to levetiracetam binding sites in rat brain. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 478, 1-9.], are almost identical in human brain samples (cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) and in CHO cell membranes expressing the human SV2A protein. Moreover, the results are also similar to those previously obtained in rat brain. [3H]ucb 30889 binding in human brain and to SV2A was saturable and reversible. At 4 degrees C, its binding kinetics were best fitted assuming a two-phase model in all tissues. The half-times of association for the fast component ranged between 1 to 2 min and represent 30% to 36% of the sites whereas the half-times for the slow component ranged from 20 to 29 min. In dissociation experiments, the half-times were from 2 to 4 min for the fast component (33% to 49% of the sites) and 20 to 41 min for the slow component. Saturation binding curves led to Kd values for [3H]ucb 30889 of 53+/-7, 55+/-9, 70+/-11 and 75+/-33 nM in human cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and CHO cells expressing SV2A respectively. Bmax values around 3-4 pmol/mg protein were calculated in all brain regions. Some of the saturation curves displayed curvilinear Scatchard plots indicating the presence of high and low affinity binding sites. When this was the case, Kd values from 25 to 30 nM for the high affinity sites (24% to 34% of total sites) and from 200 to 275 nM for the low affinity sites were calculated. This was observed in all brain regions and in CHO cell membranes expressing the SV2A protein. It cannot be explained by putative binding of [3H]ucb 30889 to SV2B or C isoforms but may reflect different patterns of SV2A glycosylation or the formation of SV2A oligomers. Competition experiments were performed to determine the affinities for SV2A of a variety of compounds including levetiracetam, some of its analogues and other molecules known to interact with levetiracetam binding sites in rat brain such as bemegride, pentylenetetrazol and chlordiazepoxide. We found an excellent correlation between the affinities of these compounds measured in human brain, rat brain and CHO cells expressing human SV2A. In conclusion, we report for the first time that the binding characteristics of native levetiracetam binding sites/SV2A in human brain and rat brain share very similar properties with human recombinant SV2A expressed in CHO cells.
16563128	Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) and vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) endocytosis in kidney epithelial cells: AQP2 is located in 'endocytosis-resistant' membrane domains after vasopressin treatment.	Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) plays an important, VP (vasopressin)-regulated role in water reabsorption by the kidney. The amount of AQP2 expressed at the surface of principal cells results from an equilibrium between the AQP2 in intracellular vesicles and the AQP2 on the plasma membrane. VP shifts the equilibrium in favour of the plasma membrane and this allows osmotic equilibration to occur between the collecting duct lumen and the interstitial space. Membrane accumulation of AQP2 could result from a VP-induced increase in exocytosis, a decrease in endocytosis, or both. In the present study, we further investigated AQP2 accumulation at the cell surface, and compared it with V2R (VP type 2 receptor) trafficking using cells that express epitope-tagged AQP2 and V2R.
16574083	Minocycline protects PC12 cells against NMDA-induced injury via inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase activation.	Recently, we have reported that minocycline, a semi-synthetic tetracycline with neuroprotective effects, inhibits the in vitro ischemic-like injury and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activation in PC12 cells. In the present study, we further determined whether minocycline protects PC12 cells from excitotoxicity via inhibiting 5-LOX activation. We used N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 200 microM) to induce early (exposure for 6 h) and delayed (exposure for 6 h followed by 24 h recovery) injuries. We found that NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, 5-LOX inhibitor caffeic acid and minocycline concentration dependently attenuated NMDA-induced early and delayed cell injuries (viability reduction and cell death). However, only ketamine (1 microM) inhibited NMDA-evoked elevation of intracellular calcium. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that NMDA induced 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear membrane after 1- to 6-h exposure which was confirmed by Western blotting, indicating that 5-LOX was activated. Ketamine, caffeic acid and minocycline (each at 1 microM) inhibited 5-LOX translocation after early injury. After delayed injury, PC12 cells were shrunk, and 5-LOX was translocated to the nuclei and nuclear membrane; ketamine, caffeic acid and minocycline inhibited both cell shrinking and 5-LOX translocation. As a control, 12-LOX inhibitor baicalein showed a weak effect on cell viability and death, but no effect on 5-LOX translocation. Therefore, we conclude that the protective effect of minocycline on NMDA-induced injury is partly mediated by inhibiting 5-LOX activation.
16574446	Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for beta2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation.	This study analyzes 16 molecular dynamic simulations of a biophysical model for beta(2)-adrenergic (B2AR) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation. In this model, a highly conserved cysteine residue, C106 (C3.25 or CysIII:01), provides a free sulfhydryl or thiol group in an acid-base equilibrium between uncharged (RSH) and charged (RS(-)) states that functions as an electrostatic molecular switch for receptor activation. The transition of C106 in the B2AR between acid and base states significantly changes the helical/transmembrane (TM) domain interactions and the electrostatic interaction energy differences (DeltaDeltaE(EL)). The DeltaDeltaE(EL) changes correlate well with the experimentally observed ligand efficacies. The TM interaction energies display patterns compatible with those previously recognized as responsible for GPCR activation. Key differences between the agonist, epinephrine, and the antagonist, pindolol, are seen for the TM3 x 6, TM3 x 4, TM6 x 7 and TM1 x 7 interaction energies. Pindolol also produces a weaker DeltaDeltaE(EL) interaction and less TM interaction energy changes, which are important differences between the agonist and antagonist ligands. The D115E mutant with pindolol displays a greater DeltaDeltaE(EL) and TM interactions than for the wild-type B2AR with pindolol. This explains the higher activity of pindolol in the D115E mutant. The constitutively active D130A mutant displays TM interaction patterns similar to those for the activating ligands implying a common pattern for receptor activation. These findings support the broad concept of protean agonism and demonstrate the potential for allosteric modulation. They also demonstrate that this two-state model agrees with many previous experimental and theoretical observations of GPCRs.
16580639	The opioid ligand binding of human mu-opioid receptor is modulated by novel splice variants of the receptor.	The pharmacological actions of morphine and morphine-like drugs, such as heroin, mediate primarily through the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). It has been proposed that the functional diversity of MOR may be related to alternative splicing of the MOR gene. Although a number of MOR mRNA splice variants have been reported, their biological function has been controversial. In this study, two novel splice variants of the human MOR gene were discovered. Splice variants 1 and 2 (here called the SV1 and SV2) retain different portions of intron I. In vitro translation of SV1 and SV2 produced proteins with the predicted molecular weights. The splice variant proteins were identical to the wild-type MOR-1 up to the first transmembrane domains, but were different after the first intracellular loop domains. SV1 and SV2 of hMOR were present in human neuroblastoma NMB cells and human whole brain confirmed by RT-PCR. In a receptor binding assay, cells expressing the SV1 and SV2 do not exhibit binding to [(3)H]diprenorphine. The formations of MOR.SV1 and MOR.SV2 heterodimers were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between MOR and splice variants. Co-transfection of MOR-GFP and SV-DsRed gene showed that MOR and SV protein co-localized at the cytoplasmic membrane. In NMB cells expressing human MOR gene, transfection of SV1 or SV2 reduced binding activity of the endogenous MOR. These data support a potential role of SV1 and SV2 proteins as possible biological modulator of human mu-opioid receptor.
16600468	Novel purification strategy for human PON1 and inhibition of the activity by cephalosporin and aminoglikozide derived antibiotics.	Human serum paraoxonase (PON1, EC 3.1.8.1.) is a high-density lipid (HDL)-associated, calcium-dependent enzyme; its physiological substrates are not known. In this study, a new purification strategy for human PON1 enzyme was developed using two-step procedures, namely ammonium sulfate precipitation and sepharose-4B-l-tyrosine-1-napthylamine hydrophobic interaction chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme indicates a single band with an apparent MW of 43 kDa. Overall purification rate of our method was found 227-fold. The V(max) and K(m) of the purified enzyme were determined 227.27 EU and 4.16 mM, respectively. The in vitro effects of commonly used antibiotics, namely gentamycin sulfate and cefazolin sodium was also investigated on the purified human serum PON1 enzyme and human liver PON1 enzyme from human hepatoma cell (HepG2). Gentamycin sulfate and cefazolin sodium caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease on PON1 activity in HepG2 cells. Moreover, gentamycin sulfate and cefazolin sodium were effective inhibitors on purified human serum PON1 activity with IC(50) of 0.887 and 0.0084 values, respectively. The kinetics of interaction of gentamycin sulfate and cefazolin sodium with the purified human serum PON1 indicated a different inhibition pattern. Cefazolin sodium showed a competitive inhibition with K(i) of 0.012+/-0.00065 mM. However, Gentamycin sulfate was inhibited in non-competitive manner with K(i) of 0.026+/-0.015. In order to determine the inhibition statue of these drugs on a living system, the effects of same antibiotics on PON1 enzyme activity of mouse serum PON1 and liver PON1 were investigated in vivo. Gentamycin sulfate (3.2 mg/kg) and cefazolin sodium (106.25 mg/kg) leads to the significant decrease in mouse serum PON1 after 2, 4, 6 h and 2, 4 h drug administration, respectively. Cefazolin sodium did not exhibit any inhibition effect for the liver PON1, in vivo.
1660351	Evidence for 5-HT1B/1D receptors mediating the antimigraine effect of sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine.	Neurogenic plasma extravasation, endothelial cell activation (increase in vesicle number and vacuole formation), platelet aggregation and adhesion, and mast cell degranulation occur selectively in post-capillary venules of the dura mater following electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation, and are mediated by release of neuropeptides from perivascular unmyelinated C fibres. Pre-treatment with the antimigraine drugs dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan, two drugs that bind with high affinity to 5-HT1B/1D receptors, markedly attenuated plasma protein extravasation induced by electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation. Trigeminal stimulation increased plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide levels in rat superior sagittal sinus. Pre-treatment with dihydroergotamine and, to a lesser extent, sumatriptan, attenuated this increase. Both drugs reduced morphological changes in post-capillary venules and mast cells within dura mater following electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation. Plasma protein extravasation was selectively blocked in dura mater (but not in extracranial tissues) by pre-treatment with those receptor agonists showing a rank order of potency suggesting a 3-HT1B/1D interaction (5-CT greater than 5-BT greater than DHE greater than sumatriptan greater than 8-OH-DPAT). Pre-treatment with 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonists was not effective. Taken together, these data are consistent with the interpretation that putative 5-HT-1B/1D receptors located on sensory fibres are coupled to inhibition of peptide release and blockade of neurogenic inflammation. An important therapeutic action of ergot alkaloids and sumatriptan in migraine headaches is so defined.
16611310	The c.-1639G > A polymorphism of the VKORC1 gene is a major determinant of the response to acenocoumarol in anticoagulated patients.	Much of the variability in the sensitivity to warfarin in anticoagulated patients is associated with the c.-1639G > A polymorphism of the vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKORC1) gene. However, its association with the acenocoumarol dose in patients under anticoagulant therapy has not been studied. The c.-1639G > A genotype of VKORC1 was determined in 113 patients on stable anticoagulation requiring low (n = 42), medium (n = 42) or high (n = 21) acenocoumarol doses. To evaluate the association between acenocoumarol requirements and the c.-1639G > A variant, multivariate logistic regression models were fitted, adjusting for age, gender, and the c.430C > T and c.1075A > C variants of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). A total of 90.5% of the patients in the low acenocoumarol dose group carried the A allele of VKORC1:c.-1639G > A. The A allele independently increased the odds of requiring a low acenocoumarol dose [odds ratio (OR) 9.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-46.4; P = 0.006], especially when the homozygous form was present (OR 44.2; 95% CI 5.5-354.6; P < 0.001). The A allele was less frequent in the high dose group showing an inverse association with the requirement for high doses (OR 0.04; 95% CI 0.01-0.22; P < 0.001). The A allele of the c.-1639G > A polymorphism of VKORC1 is therefore associated with a low-dose requirement for acenocoumarol in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
16621347	17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androst-1-en-3-one (1-testosterone) is a potent androgen with anabolic properties.	Since the begining of the year 2005, the use of steroid precursors (prohormones) is illegal in the United States; nevertheless, there is still an enormous abuse of such substances. One of the most frequently misused steroids, often declared to be a prohormone, is 1-testosterone (17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androst-1-en-3-one, 1-Testo). In this study, we have characterised molecular mechanisms of its action, determined its tissue specific androgenic and anabolic potency and investigated potential adverse effects. 1-Testo binds highly selective to the androgen receptor (AR) and has a high potency to stimulate AR dependent transactivation. In vivo an equimolar dose of 1-Testo has the same potency to stimulate the growth of the prostate, the seminal vesicles and the androgen sensitive levator ani muscle as the reference compound testosterone propionate (TP). Administration of 1-Testo, in contrast to TP, results in a significant increase of liver weight. Our results demonstrate that 1-Testo, even without being metabolised, is a very potent androgen. It binds selectively to the AR and transactivates AR dependent reporter genes. In vivo it has a high androgenic and anabolic potency and increases liver weight. In summary 1-Testo can be characterised as a typical anabolic steroid. It has to be assumed that consumption of this substance is associated with adverse side effects typical for this class of compounds. Therefore, a strict control of its ban is essential.
16629860	5-HT2B receptors do not modulate sensitivity to colonic distension in rats with acute colorectal hypersensitivity.	The 5-HT4 receptor agonist tegaserod is an effective prokinetic agent that increases gastrointestinal secretion and reduces visceral sensitivity. Tegaserod has both 5-HT4 receptor agonist and 5-HT2B receptor antagonist activity, the latter being a less potent effect of the drug. In a rat model of colonic hypersensitivity, selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists only partially reversed the antihyperalgesic effect of tegaserod suggesting that non-5-HT4 receptor-mediated mechanisms may also be involved in its overall antihyperalgesic action. The objective of this study was to determine whether 5-HT2B receptors play a role in colonic hypersensitivity. A visceromotor response (VMR) in acutely sensitized animals (intracolonic acetic acid, 0.6%, 1.5 mL) quantified colonic hypersensitivity. Acetic acid produced an increase in the VMR at all distension pressures. However, neither the 5-HT2B receptor agonist BW 723C86, the 5-HT2B antagonist SB204741 or the 5-HT2B/2C antagonist SB 206553 caused any significant inhibition of the VMR. In summary, in the same rodent model in which tegaserod has previously been shown to produce a potent antihyperalgesic effect, 5-HT2B receptors do not appear to mediate colonic hypersensitivity. We conclude that 5-HT2B receptor-mediated mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in the antihyperalgesic action of tegaserod in man.
16636268	Dual targeting of a single tRNA(Trp) requires two different tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases in Trypanosoma brucei.	The mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei does not encode any tRNAs. This deficiency is compensated for by the import of a small fraction of nearly all of its cytosolic tRNAs. Most trypanosomal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are encoded by single-copy genes, suggesting the use of the same enzyme in the cytosol and mitochondrion. However, the T. brucei genome contains two distinct genes for eukaryotic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS). RNA interference analysis established that both TrpRS1 and TrpRS2 are essential for growth and required for cytosolic and mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA formation, respectively. Decoding the mitochondrial tryptophan codon UGA requires mitochondria-specific C-->U RNA editing in the anticodon of the imported tRNA(Trp). In vitro charging assays with recombinant TrpRS enzymes demonstrated that the edited anticodon and the mitochondria-specific thiolation of U33 in the imported tRNA(Trp) act as antideterminants for the cytosolic TrpRS1. The existence of two TrpRS enzymes, therefore, can be explained by the need for a mitochondrial synthetase with extended substrate specificity to achieve aminoacylation of the imported thiolated and edited tRNA(Trp). Thus, the notion that, in an organism, all nuclear-encoded tRNAs assigned to a given amino acid are charged by a single aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, is not universally valid.
16639024	T2-TrpRS inhibits preretinal neovascularization and enhances physiological vascular regrowth in OIR as assessed by a new method of quantification.	A carboxyl-terminal fragment of tryptophan tRNA synthetase (T2-TrpRS) has demonstrated potent angiostatic activity during retinal developmental neovascularization in vivo. The effects of T2-TrpRS on pathologic neovascularization were tested and compared with a potent VEGF antagonist using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).
16682505	Agonist-selective mechanisms of mu-opioid receptor desensitization in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.	The ability of two opioid agonists, [d-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) and morphine, to induce mu-opioid receptor (MOR) phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization was examined in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing rat MOR1 as well G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) channel subunits. Both DAMGO and morphine activated GIRK currents, but the maximum response to DAMGO was greater than that of morphine, indicating that morphine is a partial agonist. The responses to DAMGO and morphine desensitized rapidly in the presence of either drug. Expression of a dominant negative mutant G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), GRK2-K220R, markedly attenuated the DAMGO-induced desensitization of MOR1, but it had no effect on morphine-induced MOR1 desensitization. In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) either by the PKC inhibitory peptide PKC (19-31) or staurosporine reduced MOR1 desensitization by morphine but not that induced by DAMGO. Morphine and DAMGO enhanced MOR1 phosphorylation over basal. The PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide 1 (GF109203X) inhibited MOR1 phosphorylation under basal conditions and in the presence of morphine, but it did not inhibit DAMGO-induced phosphorylation. DAMGO induced arrestin-2 translocation to the plasma membrane and considerable MOR1 internalization, whereas morphine did not induce arrestin-2 translocation and induced very little MOR1 internalization. Thus, DAMGO and morphine each induce desensitization of MOR1 signaling in HEK293 cells but by different molecular mechanisms; DAMGO-induced desensitization is GRK2-dependent, whereas morphine-induced desensitization is in part PKC-dependent. MORs desensitized by DAMGO activation are then readily internalized by an arrestin-dependent mechanism, whereas those desensitized by morphine are not. These data suggest that opioid agonists induce different conformations of the MOR that are susceptible to different desensitizing and internalization processes.
16704974	Surface expression of ASIC2 inhibits the amiloride-sensitive current and migration of glioma cells.	Gliomas are primary brain tumors with a complex biology characterized by antigenic and genomic heterogeneity and a propensity for invasion into normal brain tissue. High grade glioma cells possess a voltage-independent, amiloride-inhibitable, inward Na+ current. This current does not exist in normal astrocytes or low grade tumor cells. Inhibition of this conductance decreases glioma growth and cell migration making it a potential therapeutic target. Our previous results have shown that the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), members of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC)/degenerin (DEG) family of ion channels are part of this current pathway. We hypothesized that one member of the ENaC/DEG family, ASIC2, is retained intracellularly and that it is the lack of functional expression of ASIC2 at the cell surface that results in hyperactivity of this conductance in high grade gliomas. In this study we show that the chemical chaperone, glycerol, and the transcriptional regulator, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, inhibit the constitutively activated inward current and reduce cell growth and migration in glioblastoma multiforme. The results suggest that these compounds induce the movement of ASIC2 to the plasma membrane, and once there, the basally active inward current characteristic of glioma cells is abolished by inherent negative regulatory mechanisms. This in turn compromises the ability of the glioma cell to migrate and proliferate. These results support the hypothesis that the conductance pathway in high grade glioma cells is comprised of ENaC/DEG subunits and that abolishing this channel activity promotes a reversion of a high grade glioma cell to a phenotype resembling that of normal astrocytes.
16707409	The effects of ergoloid mesylates and ginkgo biloba on the pharmacokinetics of ticlopidine.	Ticlopidine is sometimes coadministered with ergoloid mesylates or ginkgo biloba in clinical situations. Our objective was to examine the effect of ergoloid mesylates and ginkgo biloba on ticlopidine pharmacokinetics. Ticlopidine, ergoloid mesylates, and ginkgo biloba significantly inhibited the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP-B)-mediated uptake of [(3)H]-estrone-3-sulfate in a concentration-dependent manner. When ergoloid mesylates was coadministered with ticlopidine, the ticlopidine area under the plasma drug concentration-time profile (AUC) from 0 to 12 hours was decreased 30% and the peak plasma drug concentration (C(max)) was decreased 29%, compared with ticlopidine administration alone. There were no significant changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticlopidine when it was coadministered with ginkgo biloba. In summary, ergoloid mesylates is a more potent inhibitor of OATP-B than is ginkgo biloba, and it can reduce the oral bioavailability of drugs transported by OATP-B. Ergoloid mesylates markedly decreased the AUC and C(max) of ticlopidine, probably by inhibiting the OATP-B-mediated uptake of ticlopidine during the intestinal absorption phase. The results support a new model of intestinal drug-drug interaction.
16708051	Ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) 2464G>A polymorphism shows an association with gemcitabine chemosensitivity in cancer cell lines.	Significant variability in the efficacy and toxicity of an anticancer drug is observed in cancer patients. Currently, there are no standard tools for prediction of a patient's tumor response or his risk of adverse events to chemotherapy.
16713439	An alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose, reduces oxidative stress markers and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in obese type 2 diabetic patients.	Postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to elucidate whether improving the postprandial state by voglibose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, leads to the reduction of oxidative stress markers and soluble adhesion molecules in obese type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 30 Japanese obese type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned and treated for 3 weeks with either diet alone (the control group) or diet plus voglibose (0.9 mg daily) (the voglibose group) (n=15 each). Analysis of the diurnal metabolic profiles revealed a significant reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in the voglibose group relative to the control group (P<.05), despite the similar improvement in body mass index and hemoglobin A(1c) in both groups. Voglibose also decreased significantly the plasma levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and urinary excretion of 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2)alpha and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (P<.01) and C-reactive protein (P<.05) relative to the control group. In conclusion, this study represents the first demonstration that voglibose reduces oxidative stress generation and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in parallel with the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients.
16723495	Cimetidine induces interleukin-18 production through H2-agonist activity in monocytes.	The present study demonstrates a possible mechanism for the improvement of gastrointestinal cancer patients' prognosis by the histamine receptor type 2 (H2R) antagonist cimetidine. This agent, but not the H2R antagonists ranitidine and famotidine, induced the production of an antitumor cytokine, interleukin (IL)-18, by human monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). In fact, ranitidine and famotidine antagonized cimetidine-induced IL-18 production. Cimetidine induced the activation of caspase-1, which is reported to modify immature IL-18 to mature/active IL-18, and the elevation of intracellular cAMP, leading to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). The PKA inhibitor H89 abolished the IL-18 production induced by cimetidine. Moreover, the effects of cimetidine on IL-18 production were reproduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from wild-type mice, but not in those from H2R knockout mice. In conclusion, cimetidine, a partial agonist for H2R, has a pharmacological profile different from ranitidine and famotidine, possibly contributing to its antitumor activity on gastrointestinal cancers.
16735511	Multiple conformations of phosphodiesterase-5: implications for enzyme function and drug development.	Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) is the target for sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil, which are drugs for treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. We report here the crystal structures of a fully active catalytic domain of unliganded PDE5A1 and its complexes with sildenafil or icarisid II. These structures together with the PDE5A1-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine complex show that the H-loop (residues 660-683) at the active site of PDE5A1 has four different conformations and migrates 7-35A upon inhibitor binding. In addition, the conformation of sildenafil reported herein differs significantly from those in the previous structures of chimerically hybridized or almost inactive PDE5. Mutagenesis and kinetic analyses confirm that the H-loop is particularly important for substrate recognition and that invariant Gly(659), which immediately precedes the H-loop, is critical for optimal substrate affinity and catalytic activity.
16749788	Practical, catalytic, asymmetric synthesis of beta-lactones via a sequential ketene dimerization/hydrogenation process: inhibitors of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase.	The recent finding that the FDA-approved antiobesity agent orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin, Xenical) is a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS) led us to develop a concise and practical asymmetric route to pseudosymmetric 3,4-dialkyl-cis-beta-lactones. The well-documented up-regulation of FAS in cancer cells makes this enzyme complex an interesting therapeutic target for cancer. The described route to 3,4-dialkyl-beta-lactones is based on a two-step process involving Calter's catalytic, asymmetric ketene dimerization of acid chlorides followed by a facial-selective hydrogenation leading to cis-substituted-beta-lactones. Importantly, the ketene dimer intermediates were found to be stable to flash chromatography, enabling opportunities for subsequent transformations of these optically active, reactive intermediates. Subsequent alpha-epimerization and alpha-alkylation or acylation led to trans-beta-lactones and beta-lactones bearing alpha-quaternary carbons, respectively. Several of the ketene dimers and beta-lactones displayed antagonistic activity (apparent Ki in the low micromolar range) in competition with a fluorogenic substrate toward a recombinant form of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase. The best antagonist, a simple phenyl-substituted cis-beta-lactone 3d, displayed an apparent Ki (2.5 +/- 0.5 microM) of only approximately 10-fold lower than that of orlistat (0.28 +/- 0.06 microM). In addition, mechanistic studies of the ketene dimerization process by ReactionView infrared spectroscopy support previous findings that ketene formation is rate determining.
16760463	The alpha subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor interacts with c-Kit and inhibits c-Kit signaling.	The cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) regulates hematopoiesis and the function of mature host defense cells through the GM-CSF receptor (GMR), which is composed of alpha (alphaGMR) and beta (betaGMR) subunits. Stem cell factor is another important hematopoietic cytokine that signals through c-Kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, and regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and erythroid development. Like other cytokine receptors, GMR and c-Kit are generally deemed as independent adaptor molecules capable of transducing cytokine-specific signals. We found that the alphaGMR directly interacts with c-Kit and that the interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic domains. Furthermore, alphaGMR inhibited c-Kit auto-phosphorylation induced by the ligand stem cell factor. Consistent with the inhibitory effect, the expression of alphaGMR was suppressed in cells whose viability was dependent on c-Kit signaling. In contrast, the alternatively spliced alpha2 isoform of the alphaGMR could not inhibit c-Kit signaling, providing a rationale for the existence of the alpha2 isoform. Our results suggest that in addition to having the commonly appreciated roles in cytokine signal transduction, the receptors alphaGMR and c-Kit could interact to coordinate their signal initiation.
1678728	[Anxiolytic effects of lisuride and its agonistic action to central 5-HT1A receptors].	Effects of lisuride, a derivative of ergot alkaloid, on central 5-HT1A receptors were investigated biochemically, behaviorally and electroencephalographically (EEG) in rats and rabbits. Effects of lisuride in water-lick conflict tests were also investigated in rats. Lisuride was found to strongly inhibit the bindings of [3H]8-OH-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe nucleus, hippocampus, cortex, amygdala and hypothalamus of rat brain. Inhibitory effects of lisuride on bindings of [3H]8-OH-DPAT in the hippocampus was almost the same as that of 5-HT (Ki = 0.5 nM) and stronger than those of the 5-HT agonist 5-MeO-DMT (Ki = 2.1 nM) or other ergot derivatives (bromocriptine and pergolide, Ki = 3.0 nM). Lisuride (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), like 8-OH-DPAT, dose-dependently induced a 5-HT behavioral syndrome in rats. Lisuride affected locomotor activity in rats, whereas 8-OH-DPAT did not. In hippocampal EEG of rabbits, lisuride (0.01-0.03 mg/kg, i.v.), like 8-OH-DPAT and diazepam, dose-dependently inhibited rhythmical slow activity (RSA) induced by acoustical stimulation (3100 Hz) and also inhibited the RSA increased by administration of anxiogenic FG7142. In water-lick conflict tests, lisuride (0.05-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), like diazepam, increased the number of shocks. These findings indicated that lisuride acts as a strong agonist on central 5-HT1A receptors and suggested that lisuride might be a potential anxiolytic.
16788729	In vivo hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in Escherichia coli increases export of 5-methylthioribose.	Escherichia coli can not synthesize methionine from 5-methylthioribose (MTR) but instead exports this sulfur-containing, energy-rich molecule into the surrounding medium. Transforming E. coli with plasmids that direct expression of the cloned coliphage T3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) hydrolase (SAMase) induces the met regulon by cleaving the SAM co-repressor to form 5'-methylthioadenosine, which is then cleaved to produce MTR. To test the effect of in vivo SAMase activity on MTR production and its fate, cultures were incubated in the presence of [35S]methionine and [methyl-3H]methionine. Cells with SAMase activity produced significantly enhanced levels (up to 40-fold in some trials) of extracellular MTR -- the only radiolabeled compound released in significant amounts -- when compared with controls. SAM synthetase (metK) mutants transformed with SAMase expression vectors did not show this increase, verifying the path through SAM as the sole route to MTR production. SAMase expression had little or no effect on intracellular MTR pools, levels of radiolabeled macromolecules, or the transfer of methyl groups to compounds that could be precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. Thus, MTR appears to be a dead-end metabolite in E. coli, begging questions about how this has evolved, the mechanism of MTR export for the cell, and whether the release of MTR is important for some other activity.
16793069	Mu opioid receptor-dependent and independent components in effects of tramadol.	Tramadol is thought to induce analgesia via both opioid and non-opioid pathways, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the roles of the mu-opioid receptor (MOP) in analgesic and rewarding effects of tramadol by using MOP knockout (KO) mice. Tramadol-induced antinociception, assessed by hot-plate and tail-flick tests, was significantly reduced in heterozygous and homozygous MOP-KO mice when compared with that in wild-type mice. Interestingly, however, tramadol retained its ability to induce significant antinociception in homozygous MOP-KO mice. The tramadol-induced antinociception remaining in homozygous MOP-KO mice was not significantly affected by methysergide, a serotonin receptor antagonist, but was partially blocked by yohimbine, an adrenaline alpha2 receptor antagonist, and both naloxone, a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, and yohimbine. In addition, antinociceptive effects of an active tramadol metabolite M1 were abolished or remarkably reduced in MOP-KO mice. On the other hand, neither wild-type nor homozygous MOP-KO mice showed significant place preference for tramadol in a conditioned place preference test, although there were slight tendencies toward preference in wild-type mice and avoidance in homozygous MOP-KO mice. These results strongly support the idea suggested in the previous pharmacological studies that MOP and the adrenaline alpha2 receptor mediate most of the analgesic properties of tramadol.
16803890	Acid ceramidase but not acid sphingomyelinase is required for tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}-induced PGE2 production.	Sphingolipids are well established effectors of signal transduction downstream of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. In a previous study, we showed that the sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) pathway couples TNF receptor to induction of the cyclooxygenase 2 gene and prostaglandin synthesis (Pettus, B. J., Bielawski, J., Porcelli, A. M., Reames, D. L., Johnson, K. R., Morrow, J., Chalfant, C. E., Obeid, L. M., and Hannun, Y. A. (2003) FASEB J. 17, 1411-1421). In this study, the requirement for acid sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin metabolites in the TNFalpha/prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) pathway was investigated. The amphiphilic compound desipramine, a frequently employed inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), blocked PGE(2) production. However, the action of desipramine was independent of its action on ASMase, since neither genetic loss of ASMase (Niemann-Pick fibroblasts) nor knockdown of ASMase using RNA interference affected TNFalpha-induced PGE(2) synthesis. Further investigations revealed that desipramine down-regulated acid ceramidase (AC), but not sphingosine kinase, at the protein level. This resulted in a time-dependent drop in sphingosine and S1P levels. Moreover, exogenous administration of either sphingosine or S1P rescued PGE(2) biosynthesis after desipramine treatment. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous AC by RNA interference attenuated cyclooxygenase 2 induction by TNFalpha and subsequent PGE(2) biosynthesis. Taken together, these results define a novel role for AC in the TNFalpha/PGE(2) pathway. In addition, the results of this study warrant careful reconsideration of desipramine as a specific inhibitor for ASMase.
16808554	Temporal relationship between use of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, and cardiovascular risk.	The search for NSAIDs with less gastrointestinal toxicity led to the introduction of the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. However, following their introduction into the market, concerns have developed regarding their safety, particularly their cardiovascular safety. The purpose of this study was to assess the cardiovascular risk (events included were myocardial infarction, stroke and myocardial infarction-related deaths) associated with long-term (>180 days of exposure) and short-term (<or=180 days of exposure) use of non-selective NSAIDs, including 'preferential COX-2 inhibitors' (i.e. etodolac, nabumetone and salsalate), and selective COX-2 inhibitors.
16815313	VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes and acenocoumarol anticoagulation status: interaction between both genotypes affects overanticoagulation.	Our objective was to assess the effects of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes on severe overanticoagulation and time to achieve stability and their contributions to dose requirement during the initial phase of acenocoumarol treatment.
16816921	Imatinib mesylate inhibits osteoclastogenesis and joint destruction in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).	Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a key factor for osteoclastogenesis at the bone-pannus interface in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as a receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). Imatinib mesylate inhibits the phosphorylation of c-fms, a receptor for M-CSF. The present study investigates the effect of imatinib mesylate on joint destruction in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and on osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Imatinib mesylate (50 or 150 mg/kg), dexamethasone, or vehicle was administered daily to CIA rats for 4 weeks from the onset of arthritis. Hind-paw swelling and body weight were measured weekly. At weeks 2 and 4, the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints and the ankle and subtalar joints were radiographically and histologically assessed. The effect of imatinib mesylate on osteoclast formation from rat bone marrow cells with M-CSF and soluble RANKL (sRANKL) in vitro was also examined. Radiographic assessment showed that 150 mg/kg imatinib mesylate suppressed the destruction of the MTP and the ankle and subtalar joints at week 2, and MTP joint destruction at week 4 in CIA rats, although hind-paw swelling was not suppressed. The number of TRAP-positive cells at the bone-pannus interface was significantly reduced in the group administered with 150 mg/kg imatinib mesylate compared with that given vehicle at week 4. Imatinib mesylate dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of M-CSF-dependent osteoclast precursor cells in vitro as well as osteoclast formation induced by M-CSF and sRANKL. These findings suggest that imatinib mesylate could prevent joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
16817851	An alternative pathway of vitamin D metabolism. Cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1)-mediated conversion to 20-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin D2.	We report an alternative, hydroxylating pathway for the metabolism of vitamin D2 in a cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc; CYP11A1) reconstituted system. NMR analyses identified solely 20-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin D2 derivatives. 20-Hydroxyvitamin D2 was produced at a rate of 0.34 mol x min(-1) x mol(-1) P450scc, and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin D2 was produced at a rate of 0.13 mol x min(-1) x mol(-1). In adrenal mitochondria, vitamin D2 was metabolized to six monohydroxy products. Nevertheless, aminoglutethimide (a P450scc inhibitor) inhibited this adrenal metabolite formation. Initial testing of metabolites for biological activity showed that, similar to vitamin D2, 20-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 17,20-dihydroxyvitamin D2 inhibited DNA synthesis in human epidermal HaCaT keratinocytes, although to a greater degree. 17,20-Dihydroxyvitamin D2 stimulated transcriptional activity of the involucrin promoter, again to a significantly greater extent than vitamin D2, while the effect of 20-hydroxyvitamin D2 was statistically insignificant. Thus, P450scc can metabolize vitamin D2 to generate novel products, with intrinsic biological activity (at least in keratinocytes).
16818707	Pharmacologic basis for the enhanced efficacy of dutasteride against prostatic cancers.	Prostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration is regulated by precursors from systemic circulation and prostatic enzymes of androgen metabolism, particularly 5alpha-reductases (i.e., SRD5A1 and SRD5A2). Therefore, the levels of expression SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 and the antiprostatic cancer growth response to finasteride, a selective SRD5A2 inhibitor, versus the dual SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 inhibitor, dutasteride, were compared.
16824050	Inflammation of actinic keratoses subsequent to therapy with sorafenib, a multitargeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor.	The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway is frequently dysregulated in human malignancies, as is angiogenesis and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) pathway. These kinases are therefore important anticancer targets. The novel, oral treatment sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), has been shown to be an inhibitor of VEGFR, Raf and platelet-derived growth factor in clinical trials against a variety of cancers, with the greatest activity to date observed in metastatic renal cancer. Although side-effects with this targeted therapy are usually not dose-limiting, they frequently involve the skin, and consist of a maculopapular rash, palmar-plantar dysaesthesia, alopecia and xerosis. In this report, we present two patients in whom treatment with sorafenib resulted in inflammation of actinic keratosis, which in some cases progressed to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. This side-effect is of clinical importance, as early recognition is critical for early treatment and may represent a source of additional morbidity to these patients.
16835302	The active metabolite of Clopidogrel disrupts P2Y12 receptor oligomers and partitions them out of lipid rafts.	P2Y12, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a central role in platelet activation has been recently identified as the receptor targeted by the antithrombotic drug, clopidogrel. In this study, we further deciphered the mechanism of action of clopidogrel and of its active metabolite (Act-Met) on P2Y12 receptors. Using biochemical approaches, we demonstrated the existence of homooligomeric complexes of P2Y12 receptors at the surface of mammalian cells and in freshly isolated platelets. In vitro treatment with Act-Met or in vivo oral administration to rats with clopidogrel induced the breakdown of these oligomers into dimeric and monomeric entities in P2Y12 expressing HEK293 and platelets respectively. In addition, we showed the predominant association of P2Y12 oligomers to cell membrane lipid rafts and the partitioning of P2Y12 out of rafts in response to clopidogrel and Act-Met. The raft-associated P2Y12 oligomers represented the functional form of the receptor, as demonstrated by binding and signal transduction studies. Finally, using a series of receptors individually mutated at each cysteine residue and a chimeric P2Y12/P2Y13 receptor, we pointed out the involvement of cysteine 97 within the first extracellular loop of P2Y12 in the mechanism of action of Act-Met.
16841073	Lack of lithium-like behavioral and molecular effects in IMPA2 knockout mice.	Lithium is a potent mood-stabilizing medication in bipolar disorder. Despite 50 years of clinical use, the mechanism of action is unknown. Multiple effects have been attributed to lithium including the uncompetitive inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase). IMPA2, one of the genes that encode IMPase, is located in a region with linkage to bipolar disorder. Owing to the role of IMPase in cell signaling and the possibility that this enzyme is a target for mood-stabilizing drugs, we generated IMPA2(-/-) mice. Possible involvement of IMPase in complex behaviors related to affective disorders was assessed by monitoring the behavior of the IMPA2(-/-) mice in the forced swim test, the tail suspension test (TST), the elevated zero-maze and open field test. It has been described that chronically lithium-treated mice exhibit reduced immobility time in the forced swim test and decreased exploratory behavior. We found increased rearing of IMPA2(-/-) mice in the open field, suggesting an increased exploratory behavior. Although immobility time of IMPA2(-/-) female but not male mice in the forced swim test was reduced, no difference was found between male and female IMPA2(-/-) and IMPA2(+/+) mice in the TST and overall there was no clear effect of the deletion of IMPA2 on depression-like behavior. Frontal cortex IMPase activity and inositol levels in the IMPA2(-/-) mice did not differ from IMPA2(+/+) mice, but kidney inositol levels were reduced. In conclusion, phenotypic characterization of the IMPA2(-/-) mouse indicates that deleting IMPA2 does not mimic the effects of lithium treatment.
16854056	Characterization of the histamine H4 receptor binding site. Part 1. Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of dibenzodiazepine derivatives.	A series of dibenzodiazepine derivatives was synthesized to probe the binding site of the recently discovered histamine H4 receptor (H4R). Optimization of the lead structure clozapine (2) resulted in (E)-7-chloro-11-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepine (7j), a potent H4R agonist (H4R, pKi = 7.6). Pharmacological data suggests that the series of nonimidazole compounds can be used to describe the orthosteric binding site of the H4R because both 2 and 7j displace [3H]histamine in a competitive manner. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the effects of 7j are competitively antagonized by the selective H4R antagonist JNJ 7777120 (1), indicating considerable overlap of their binding sites. On the basis of the derived structure-activity relationships and additional pharmacological results, a pharmacophore model was constructed, which will be the premise for the design of novel H4R ligands.
16855451	Postpartum depression: a randomized trial of sertraline versus nortriptyline.	Symptom reduction and improvement in functioning in women with postpartum major depression treated with a tricyclic antidepressant versus a serotonin reuptake inhibitor were compared. The design was a double-blind, 8-week comparative trial of nortriptyline (NTP) versus sertraline (SERT) with a 16-week continuation phase. Women aged 18 to 45 years with postpartum major depression and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of 18 or more were eligible. Subjects were randomized to NTP or SERT and treated with a fixed-dosing strategy. Of 420 women interviewed, 109 eligible women received medication, and 95 provided follow-up data. The proportion of women who responded and remitted did not differ between drugs at 4, 8, or 24 weeks. Times to response and remission also did not differ. Psychosocial functioning improved similarly in both drug-treated groups of mothers. The total side effect burden of each drug was similar, although side effect profiles differed between agents. No clinical or demographic variables differentiated responders by drug. Women who were responders and remitters at week 8 could be identified earlier if they were treated with SERT than with NTP. Breast-fed infant serum levels were near or below the level of quantifiability for both agents.
16857744	Reciprocal regulation of a glucocorticoid receptor-steroidogenic factor-1 transcription complex on the Dax-1 promoter by glucocorticoids and adrenocorticotropic hormone in the adrenal cortex.	Numerous genes required for adrenocortical steroidogenesis are activated by the nuclear hormone receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) (NR5A1). Dax-1 (NR0B1), another nuclear hormone receptor, represses SF-1-dependent activation. Glucocorticoid products of the adrenal cortex provide negative feedback to the production of hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH. We hypothesized that glucocorticoids stimulate an intraadrenal negative feedback loop via activation of Dax-1 expression. Reporter constructs show glucocorticoid-dependent synergy between SF-1 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the activation of Dax-1, which is antagonized by ACTH signaling. We map the functional glucocorticoid response element between -718 and -704 bp, required for activation by GR and synergy with SF-1. Of three SF-1 response elements, only the -128-bp SF-1 response element is required for synergy with GR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that dexamethasone treatment increases GR and SF-1 binding to the endogenous murine Dax-1 promoter 10- and 3.5-fold over baseline. Serial ChIP assays reveal that that GR and SF-1 are part of the same complex on the Dax-1 promoter, whereas coimmunoprecipitation assay confirms the presence of a protein complex that contains both GR and SF-1. ACTH stimulation disrupts the formation of this complex by abrogating SF-1 binding to the Dax-1 promoter, while promoting SF-1 binding to the melanocortin-2 receptor (Mc2r) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) promoters. Finally, dexamethasone treatment increases endogenous Dax-1 expression and concordantly decreases StAR expression. ACTH signaling antagonizes the increase in Dax-1 yet strongly activates StAR transcription. These data indicate that GR provides feedback regulation of adrenocortical steroid production through synergistic activation of Dax-1 with SF-1, which is antagonized by ACTH activation of the adrenal cortex.
16860312	Suppression of ischemia/reperfusion liver injury by histamine H4 receptor stimulation in rats.	Inflammatory reactions play an important role in ischemia/reperfusion injury in various organs. Since histamine is closely related to inflammatory reactions and immune responses, effects of postischemic administration of histaminergic ligands on ischemia-induced liver injury were examined in rats. Animals were subjected to warm ischemia for 30 min by occlusion of the left portal vein and hepatic artery under halothane anesthesia, and liver damage was evaluated by assessing plasma concentrations of transaminases after 24 h. Warm ischemia for 30 min provoked severe liver damage after 24 h, and the plasma concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were 8600 I.U./l and 13100 I.U./l, respectively. Subcutaneous injections of histamine twice, immediately and 6 h after reperfusion (20 mg/kg, each), alleviated liver damage. The plasma concentrations of ALT and AST in the histamine group were 35% and 24% of those in the control group, respectively. Neither mepyramine (3 mg/kg x 2), an H1 antagonist, nor cimetidine (15 mg/kg x 2), an H2 antagonist, affected the outcome in histamine-treated rats. However, thioperamide (5 mg/kg x 2), an H3/H4 antagonist, completely abolished the alleviation caused by histamine. Administration of dimaprit (1-10 mg/kg x 2), an H2/H4 agonist, mimicked the protective effect of histamine, and the effect of dimaprit is reversed by thioperamide, whereas neither H1 nor H2 antagonists altered the outcome caused by dimaprit. Clozapine (15 mg/kg x 2), an H4 agonist, also mimicked the protective effect of histamine. These findings indicate that stimulation of histamine H4 receptors after ischemic events prevents development of reperfusion injury in the liver.
16860785	Inhibition of two different cholinesterases by tacrine.	Kinetic parameters of the effect of tacrine as a cholinesterase inhibitor have been studied in two different sources: snake venom (Bungarus sindanus) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Tacrine inhibited both venom acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as human serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in a concentration-dependent manner. Kinetic studies indicated that the nature of inhibition was mixed for both enzymes, i.e. Km values increase and Vmax decrease with the increase of the tacrine concentration. The calculated IC50 for snake venom and for human serum were 31 and 25.6 nM, respectively. Ki was observed to be 13 nM for venom acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 12 nM for serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). KI (constant of AChE-ASCh-tacrine complex into AChE-ASCh complex and tacrine) was estimated to be 20 nM for venom and 10 nM for serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), while the gammaKm (dissociation constant of AChE-ASCh-tacrine complex into AChE-tacrine complex and ASCh) were 0.086 and 0.147 mM for snake venom AChE and serum BChE, respectively. The present results suggest that this therapeutic agent used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease can also be considered an inhibitor of snake venom and human serum butyrylcholinesterase. Values of Ki and KI show that tacrine had more affinity with these enzymes as compared with other cholinesterases from the literature.
16864492	Distribution of specific binding sites for cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor antagonist in human nasal mucosa.	The high density of [3H]-pranlukast binding sites on the local leukocytes in human nasal mucosa suggests that CysLT1 receptor antagonists may directly modulate cellular function of the local leukocytes through binding to CysLT1 receptor on allergic nasal mucosa.
16864903	Olopatadine suppresses the migration of THP-1 monocytes induced by S100A12 protein.	Olopatadine hydrochloride (olopatadine) is an antiallergic drug with histamine H(1) receptor antagonistic activity. Recently, olopatadine has been shown to bind to S100A12 which is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, and exerts multiple proinflammatory activities including chemotaxis for monocytes and neutrophils. In this study, we examined the possibility that the interaction of olopatadine with S100A12 inhibits the proinflammatory effects of S100A12. Pretreatment of olopatadine with S100A12 reduced migration of THP-1, a monocyte cell line, induced by S100A12 alone, but did not affect recombinant human regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)-induced migration. Amlexanox, which also binds to S100A12, inhibited the THP-1 migration induced by S100A12. However, ketotifen, another histamine H(1) receptor antagonist, had little effect on the activity of S100A12. These results suggest that olopatadine has a new mechanism of action, that is, suppression of the function of S100A12, in addition to histamine H(1) receptor antagonistic activity.
16869821	A case study of acenocoumarol sensitivity and genotype-phenotype discordancy explained by combinations of polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9.	To determine the cause of a genotype-phenotype discordancy for acenocoumarol sensitivity. Methods A patient, highly sensitive to acenocoumarol, and previously determined to carry only a single CYP2C9*3 allele, was genotyped for additional functionally defective alleles in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. Family members were also analyzed to trace the pedigree. Results The acenocoumarol-sensitive patient was found to possess, in addition to CYP2C9*3 allele, a CYP2C9*11 allele and the VKORC1 AA diplotype which were all traced back through the parental lines. Conclusions Acenocoumarol sensitivity in this subject is the consequence of inheritance of multiple functionally defective alleles in both the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. The study provides additional data in support of diminished CYP2C9 activity due to the presence of the rare *11 allele.
16885432	Modafinil occupies dopamine and norepinephrine transporters in vivo and modulates the transporters and trace amine activity in vitro.	2-[(Diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl]acetamide (modafinil), prescribed principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment for other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions. The neurochemical substrates of modafinil are unresolved. We postulated that modafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), or serotonin (SERT) transporter activities. In vivo, we determined DAT and NET occupancy by modafinil by positron emission tomography imaging; in vitro, we determined modafinil activity at the DAT, NET, SERT, and rhesus monkey trace amine receptor 1 (TA1). In rhesus monkey, modafinil occupancy of striatal DAT was detected by [(11)C]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-4-(fluorophenyl)tropane and of thalamic NET by [(11)C](S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-benzyl)morpholine. In vitro, modafinil effects in DAT-human embryonic kidney (HEK), NET-HEK, and SERT-HEK cells were investigated alone or combined with the TA1 receptor. Modafinil (i.v.) occupied striatal DAT sites (5 mg/kg: 35 +/- 12%, n = 4; 8 mg/kg: 54 +/- 3%, n = 3). In thalamus, modafinil occupied NET sites (5 mg/kg: 16 +/- 7.8%, n = 6; 8 mg/kg: 44 +/- 12%; n = 2). In vitro, modafinil inhibited [(3)H]dopamine (IC(50) = 6.4 microM), [(3)H]norepinephrine (IC(50) = 35.6 microM), and [(3)H]serotonin (IC(50) > 500 microM) transport via the human DAT, NET, and SERT. Modafinil did not activate the TA1 receptor in TA1-HEK cells, but it augmented a monoamine transporter-dependent enhancement of phenethylamine activation of TA1 in TA1-DAT and TA1-NET cells, but not in TA1-SERT cells. The present data provide compelling evidence that modafinil occupies the DAT and NET in living brain of rhesus monkeys and raise the possibility that modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catecholamine transporters in brain.
16886928	Dipyridamole may induce migraine in patients with migraine without aura.	Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and adenosine re-uptake. The most prominent side-effect is headache. We examined the migraine-generating effects of dipyridamole as well as the cerebral blood velocity response in a single-blind study, including 10 patients with migraine without aura and 10 healthy subjects. Dipyridamole 0.142 mg/kg per min was administered intravenously. Headache intensity was scored on a verbal rating scale along with pain characteristics and accompanying symptoms. Blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(mca)), blood pressure and heart rate were recorded repeatedly. Headache was induced in all migraine patients and in eight of 10 healthy subjects (P = 0.47) with no significant difference in headache intensity (P = 0.53). However, five patients but only one healthy subject experienced the symptoms of migraine without aura, according to ICHD-2 criteria, within 12 h (P = 0.14). Four patients reported photophobia after dipyridamole compared with no healthy subjects (P = 0.087). V(mca) decreased (P < 0.001) during and after dipyridamole infusion with no difference between groups (P = 0.15) coinciding with initiation, but not cessation of immediate headache. Thus, dipyridamole induces symptoms of migraine and an initial decrease in V(mca) in migraine patients, but not significantly more than in healthy subjects. This relatively low frequency of migraine induction, compared with nitric oxide donors and sildenafil, is probably due to the less specific action of dipyridamole on the cGMP signalling pathway as well as a possible bidirectional effect of adenosine on migraine induction.
16892359	Structural basis for the exceptional in vivo efficacy of bisphosphonate drugs.	To understand the structural basis for bisphosphonate therapy of bone diseases, we solved the crystal structures of human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) in its unliganded state, in complex with the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP) drugs zoledronate, pamidronate, alendronate, and ibandronate, and in the ternary complex with zoledronate and the substrate isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). By revealing three structural snapshots of the enzyme catalytic cycle, each associated with a distinct conformational state, and details about the interactions with N-BPs, these structures provide a novel understanding of the mechanism of FPPS catalysis and inhibition. In particular, the accumulating substrate, IPP, was found to bind to and stabilize the FPPS-N-BP complexes rather than to compete with and displace the N-BP inhibitor. Stabilization of the FPPS-N-BP complex through IPP binding is supported by differential scanning calorimetry analyses of a set of representative N-BPs. Among other factors such as high binding affinity for bone mineral, this particular mode of FPPS inhibition contributes to the exceptional in vivo efficacy of N-BP drugs. Moreover, our data form the basis for structure-guided design of optimized N-BPs with improved pharmacological properties.
16895478	Treatment of MCF-7 cells with taxol and etoposide induces distinct alterations in the expression of apoptosis-related genes BCL2, BCL2L12, BAX, CASPASE-9 and FAS.	We studied alterations in the mRNA expression levels of BCL2 (Bcl-2), BCL2L12, BAX, FAS and CASPASE-9 genes in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in response to treatment with two anticancer drugs. Cell toxicity was evaluated by the MTT method, trypan blue staining and DNA laddering, whereas the expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes were analysed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. In the case of etoposide, down-regulation of the BCL2L12-A gene variant and of CASPASE-9, as well as upregulation of BAX, was observed, whereas treatment of MCF-7 cells with taxol led to down-regulation of the mRNA levels of all genes examined. Our results support the idea that after long-term clinical studies, mRNA expression analysis of BCL2L12 and other members of the BCL2 gene family may serve as useful molecular markers predicting chemotherapy response in breast cancer.
16895552	Reduced sinoatrial cAMP content plays a role in postnatal heart rate slowing in the rabbit.	1. Decreasing heart rate during development is known to be the result of parasympathetic nervous system maturation that depresses the pacemaker current (If) by acetylcholine (ACh). However, a direct effect of ACh on If has been ruled out and the involvement of other secondary messengers, such as cAMP, was verified in previous studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that reduced basal cAMP production in sinoatrial (SA) nodal cells may contribute to the slowing of heart rate after birth. 2. The electrocardiogram and heart rate variability (HRV) were documented and measured in vivo and in vitro (in isolated perfused Langendorff preparations) for rabbits aged 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks. Sinoatrial node action potential (AP) recording and perforated patch-clamp analyses were used to investigate the spontaneous depolarization rate and pacemaker If currents. Concentrations of cAMP in SA nodal tissues were determined by radioimmunoassay. Relative expression of adenylate cyclases (ADCY1, 5) and phosphodiesterases (PDE1A, 4A and 8A) were quantified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. Significantly reduced heart rate, but unchanged HRV, was observed in perfused hearts in the older age groups, accompanied with a slowed phase 4 spontaneous depolarization rate (90.5 +/- 4.7 vs 49.6 +/- 2.6 mV/s for 2 week vs 4 week hearts, respectively; n = 5; P < 0.05), a negative shift of the If threshold potential (-45.5 +/- 3.0 vs -51.1 +/- 6.0 mV for 2 week vs 4 week hearts, respectively; n = 9; P < 0.05) and decreasing basal levels of SA nodal cAMP (0.31 +/- 0.05 vs 0.025 +/- 0.002 micromol/L for 2 week vs 4 week hearts, respectively; n = 6; P < 0.05). Gene expression levels of PDE1A, 4A and 8A were increased in the 12 week group compared with the 2 week group 1.5-, 2- and 1.8-fold, respectively (P < 0.05), with little change in ADCY1 and 5. 4. These data suggest that, in addition to autonomic innervation, slowing of heart rate during postnatal maturation can be attributed to a negative shift of the If activation caused by diminished baseline cAMP content in SA nodal cells.
16899369	Synthesis of bicyclic molecular scaffolds (BTAa): an investigation towards new selective MMP-12 inhibitors.	Starting from 3-aza-6,8-dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold (BTAa) a virtual library of molecules was generated and screened in silico against the crystal structure of the Human Macrophage Metalloelastase (MMP-12). The molecules obtaining high score were synthesized and the affinity for the catalytic domain of MMP-12 was experimentally proved by NMR experiments. A BTAa scaffold 20 having a N-hydroxyurea group in position 3 and a p-phenylbenzylcarboxy amide in position 7 showed a fair inhibition potency (IC50 = 149 microM) for MMP-12 and some selectivity towards five different MMPs. These results, taken together with the X-ray structure of the adduct between MMP-12, the inhibitor 20 and the acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), suggest that bicyclic scaffold derivatives may be exploited for the design of new selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs).
1690310	Anticholinergic action of disopyramide in intestinal smooth muscle of the guinea pig: inhibition of muscarinic receptors (M1 and M2).	Antimuscarinic actions of disopyramide were investigated by measuring the contractile responses of intestinal smooth muscles and ligand binding in cardiac and intestinal membrane preparations. Disopyramide caused a parallel shift of the dose-response curves for acetylcholine, McN-A-343, and carbachol to the right in the guinea pig taenia caeci; pA2 values were 5.4 for acetylcholine, 5.5 for McN-A-343 and 5.9 for carbachol. In the guinea pig ileum, disopyramide competitively antagonized acetylcholine in the contractile responses, having the pA2 value of 6.1. In microsomal fractions of the guinea pig taenia caecum and heart, disopyramide was capable of replacing 3H-QNB; K1 values were 7 x 10(-6) M for the taenia and 2 x 10(-6) M for the heart. These results suggest that disopyramide exerts antimuscarinic action through M1 and M2 receptors with a potency approximately 3 times greater for M2 than M1.
16905159	Parallel regulation by olanzapine of the patterns of expression of 5-HT2A and D3 receptors in rat central nervous system and blood cells.	Patterns of protein expression can be used to identify biomarkers of disease, prognosis or treatment response. Peripheral 5-HT2A and D3 receptors have been proposed as protein markers in schizophrenia. We investigated the possible parallel regulation of these candidate biomarkers in central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral blood cells by a comparative study of the effects of antipsychotic treatment on the expression of the receptors in both systems in rats. Acute (24 and 48 h) and subchronic (16 days) treatment of rats with olanzapine induced a significant decrease in 5-HT2A receptor density both in frontal cortex (Bmax=76.2%, 83.0% and 46.0% of control after 24 h, 48 h and 16 days of treatment, respectively; P<0.01) and blood platelets (Bmax approximately 55% of control at all times measured; P<0.01), without any changes in receptor affinity. Furthermore, olanzapine induced redistribution in 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity and time-dependent remodelling of synaptic circuits involved in the activity of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in frontoparietal motor cortex of treated rats, as assessed by immunohistochemical studies. D3 receptor mRNA levels increased significantly by 52.5% (P<0.01) and 21.1% (P<0.05) in nucleus accumbens, and by 53.4% (P<0.05) and 91.7% (P<0.01) in lymphocytes, after acute (24 h and 48 h) treatment with olanzapine, returning to levels similar to control after subchronic treatment (16 days). In conclusion, we observed in rats after olanzapine treatment: (1) parallelism in the regulation of 5-HT2A receptors in frontal cortex and in blood platelets; (2) parallelism in the regulation of D3 mRNA levels in nucleus accumbens and lymphocytes. These results endorse the interest in future studies aimed at validating these receptors as candidate biomarkers in schizophrenia.
16906017	The mu-opioid receptor gene polymorphism 118A>G depletes alfentanil-induced analgesia and protects against respiratory depression in homozygous carriers.	To investigate whether OPRM1 118A>G polymorphism affects analgesic and respiratory depressive effects of alfentanil and assess its role for the therapeutic range of alfentanil.
16917013	System for expression of microsporidian methionine amino peptidase type 2 (MetAP2) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Microsporidia are parasitic protists of all classes of vertebrates and most invertebrates. They recently emerged as important infections in various immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patient populations. They are also important veterinary and agricultural pathogens. Current therapies for microsporidiosis include benzimidazoles, which bind tubulin-inhibiting microtubule assembly, and fumagillin and its derivatives, which bind and inhibit methionine amino peptidase type 2 (MetAP2). Benzimidazoles are not active against Enterocytozoon bieneusi, the most common cause of human microsporidiosis. Fumagillin is active against most microsporidia, including E. bieneusi, but thrombocytopenia has been a problem in clinical trials. There is a pressing need for more-specific microsporidian MetAP2 inhibitors. To expedite and facilitate the discovery of safe and effective MetAP2 inhibitors, we have engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be dependent on Encephalitozoon cuniculi MetAP2 (EcMetAP2) for its growth, where EcMetAP2 is harbored on an episomal uracil-selectable tetracycline-regulated plasmid. We have also constructed a leucine-selectable tetracycline-regulated expression plasmid into which any MetAP2 gene can be cloned. By utilizing a 5-fluoroorotic acid-mediated plasmid shuffle in the EcMetAP2 yeast strain, a yeast strain can be generated whose growth is dependent on MetAP2 from any organism. The level of heterologous MetAP2 gene expression can be controlled by the addition of tetracycline to the growth medium. These yeast strains should permit high-throughput screening for the identification of new inhibitors with high specificity and activity toward microsporidian MetAP2.
16942602	Succinic semialdehyde couples stress response to quorum-sensing signal decay in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.	Quorum sensing (QS) signal decay in Agrobacterium tumefaciens occurs in response to starvation or host signals. We have demonstrated that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt metabolite links stress response to QS signal decay. Mutation of the aldH gene encoding a succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) that converts succinic semialdehyde (SSA) to succinic acid results in early expression of the signal degrading enzyme, AttM. Exogenous addition of SSA or its precursor GABA induces AttM expression and abolishes Ti plasmid conjugative transfer. SSA acts by binding to the repressor AttJ that regulates the attKLM operon. attK encodes another SSADH. The stress alarmone ppGpp and SSA modulates separately the expression of the two SSADH enzymes, which might control the intracellular SSA level and hence to switch on/off the QS signal decay system in response to environmental changes. These findings document for the first time a sophisticated signalling mechanism of the widely conserved GABA degradation pathway in prokaryotes.
16945924	Azumolene inhibits a component of store-operated calcium entry coupled to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor.	Dantrolene reduces the elevated myoplasmic Ca(2+) generated during malignant hyperthermia, a pharmacogenetic crisis triggered by volatile anesthetics. Although specific binding of dantrolene to the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), the Ca(2+) release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, has been demonstrated, there is little evidence for direct dantrolene inhibition of RyR1 channel function. Recent studies suggest store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) contributes to skeletal muscle function, but the effect of dantrolene on this pathway has not been examined. Here we show that azumolene, an equipotent dantrolene analog, inhibits a component of SOCE coupled to activation of RyR1 by caffeine and ryanodine, whereas the SOCE component induced by thapsigargin is not affected. Our data suggest that azumolene distinguishes between two mechanisms of cellular signaling to SOCE in skeletal muscle, one that is coupled to and one independent from RyR1.
16952163	Comparing sertindole to other new generation antipsychotics on preferential dopamine output in limbic versus striatal projection regions: mechanism of action.	The effects of acute administration of sertindole on DA output were examined in the shell part of the nucleus accumbens (NACS) and the striatum (STR), areas which are associated with limbic functions and motor control, respectively, by using in vivo differential normal pulse voltammetry in rats. The effect of sertindole was compared to those obtained with the reference antipsychotic drugs clozapine and haloperidol, new generation antipsychotics represented by risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, as well as, with those of preferential D2/3, D4, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, alpha1, and alpha2 receptor ligands. In similarity with the new generation antipsychotics, sertindole preferentially increase DA output in the NACS as compared to the STR whereas the opposite was true for haloperidol. The regional specific effect of the partial D2 receptor agonist aripiprazole was mainly driven by a decrease in striatal rather that by an increase in accumbal DA output. The selective 5-HT2A and D4 receptor antagonists MDL100,151 and Lu 38-012, respectively, both preferentially increased DA output in the NACS. Thus, the present results are in line with the hypothesis that 5-HT2A receptor antagonism is of importance for the observed limbic selectivity of new generation antipsychotics and, in turn, to their favorable clinical profile especially as regards extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) liability. For some compounds, blockade of D4 receptors may also play a role in this regard.
16966178	Fluconazole resistance mechanisms in Candida krusei: the contribution of efflux-pumps.	The main resistance mechanism for fluconazole in Candida krusei is the diminished sensitivity of the target enzyme cytochrome P450 sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) to inhibition by azole agents. An alternative mechanism of resistance, efflux-pump activity, has been proposed. The aim of our study was to find out the possible contribution of efflux-pumps in conferring resistance to fluconazole in 33 C. krusei isolates from different clinical sources. The activity of efflux-pumps was checked using the inhibitor CCCP (carbonyl cyanide 3-chloro-phenylhydrazone), which decreases the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) when resistance is attributed. We established a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml of CCCP. The susceptibility patterns of our isolates for five antifungal drugs (amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, flucytosine and voriconazole) were determined according to an NCCLS M27-A2 protocol modification (Sensititre Yeast One). We tested all the strains before and after adding CCCP to the RPMI medium. The MIC90s and ranges of the drugs were identical before and after addition of CCCP. The MIC for fluconazole was higher than for the other antifungals. The new triazoles were active and the MICs were lower, although this should be interpreted carefully as the drugs showed different cut-offs. Only one isolate showed a two-fold decrease in MIC to fluconazole when CCCP was added. We did not find any multi-resistant strains. According to our study with C. krusei, CCCP-inhibited efflux-pumps do not play a significant role in resistance to fluconazole.
16966686	RRM1 modulated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of gemcitabine and platinum in non-small-cell lung cancer.	RRM1 encodes the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and is a molecular target of gemcitabine. Previous studies showed increased RRM1 expression on continuous exposure of cell lines to gemcitabine and suggested improved survival for patients with low as opposed to high tumoral RRM1 expression when treated with gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. However, the principal hypothesis that intratumoral levels of gene expression are associated with disease response has not been addressed.
16971653	First detection of the Ambler class C 1 AmpC beta-lactamase in Citrobacter freundii by a new, simple double-disk synergy test.	We report on the first detection of an AmpC-type Ambler class C 1 (ACC-1) beta-lactamase in Citrobacter freundi isolated from a patient also harboring ACC-1-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We propose a simple cefoxitin-based double-disk synergy test (DDST) for the specific detection of ACC-1 in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including natural AmpC producers, in association with a cloxacillin-based DDST as a first-line AmpC-type beta-lactamase screening test.
16981227	Effects of DRD2 and CYP2D6 genotypes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers: a preliminary study.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers. Seventeen volunteers were recruited according to the DRD2 Taq1A genotype, and separated into the following groups: homozygous wild-type (A2/A2, n = 7), heterozygous (A2/A1, n = 5) and homozygous variant-type (A1/A1, n = 5) groups. After enrollment in this study, they were genotyped for CYP2D6. The volunteers received single 10 mg oral doses of aripiprazole, in accordance with an open-label parallel group study design. Plasma levels of aripiprazole and its metabolite were determined and EEGs were obtained simultaneously. The pharmacodynamic parameter was absolute delta power in the Cz channel. The changes of delta power were not different according to DRD2 Taq1A genotypes. As to the CYP2D6 allele, the subjects had the following CYP2D6 genotypes: *10/*10 (n = 4), *1/*10 (n = 5), *1/*5 (n = 2), *1/*1 (n = 3), *2/*41 (n = 1), *2/*2 (n = 1), *2N/*10 (n = 1). Subjects exhibiting the *1/*5 and *1/*10 genotypes showed a trend toward high area under the plasma aripiprazole concentration-time curve (AUC), which was linearly related to area under the EEG response-time curve (AUEC). Our results demonstrate a need for further evaluation of the CYP2D6 genotypic effect on the pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole.
16981708	Characterization of the acyl substrate binding pocket of acetyl-CoA synthetase.	AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase [ACS; acetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6.2.1.1] catalyzes the activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA in a two-step reaction. This enzyme is a member of the adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily that includes firefly luciferase, nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and acyl- and aryl-CoA synthetases/ligases. Although the structures of several superfamily members demonstrate that these enzymes have a similar fold and domain structure, the low sequence conservation and diversity of the substrates utilized have limited the utility of these structures in understanding substrate binding in more distantly related enzymes in this superfamily. The crystal structures of the Salmonella enterica ACS and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACS1 have allowed a directed approach to investigating substrate binding and catalysis in ACS. In the S. enterica ACS structure, the propyl group of adenosine 5'-propylphosphate, which mimics the acyl-adenylate intermediate, lies in a hydrophobic pocket. Modeling of the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus Z245 ACS (MT-ACS1) on the S. cerevisiae ACS structure showed similar active site architecture, and alignment of the amino acid sequences of proven ACSs indicates that the four residues that compose the putative acetate binding pocket are well conserved. These four residues, Ile312, Thr313, Val388, and Trp416 of MT-ACS1, were targeted for alteration, and our results support that they do indeed form the acetate binding pocket and that alterations at these positions significantly alter the enzyme's affinity for acetate as well as the range of acyl substrates that can be utilized. In particular, Trp416 appears to be the primary determinant for acyl chain length that can be accommodated in the binding site.
16983399	No evidence for binding of clozapine, olanzapine and/or haloperidol to selected receptors involved in body weight regulation.	The underlying mechanisms of antipsychotic (AP)-induced weight gain are unknown, but both central and peripheral AP target receptors could potentially be involved. This study used radioligand binding assays to compare the binding affinities of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol for candidate receptors potentially involved in AP-induced weight gain. Selected candidates derived from known pathways involved in body weight regulation included receptors classified as anorexigenic (bombesin receptor subtype 3, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, cholecystokinin receptor, melanocortin-4 receptor, neurotensin receptor 1) or orexigenic (cannabinoid receptor 1, galanin 1 receptor, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR), neuropeptide Y1 receptor) as well as receptors involved in physiological actions related to digestion and fluid homeostasis (angiotensin II type 1 receptor, bradykinin B2 receptor, endothelin receptor, neurokinin 1 receptor, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1). Clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol exhibited negligible affinities to all of these receptors except for the MCHR (Ki=501 nM; haloperidol). With respect to other candidates from (neuro)transmitter systems already suggested to be involved in AP-induced weight gain, the binding profile of olanzapine resembled that of clozapine, with high affinity (Ki<10 nM) for serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT6, muscarinic M1 and histamine H1 receptors. In contrast, the binding profile of haloperidol was substantially different (high affinity only for the dopamine D1 receptor). In conclusion, we have not identified a novel binding site of the two investigated atypical AP that could contribute to the induced weight gain.
17000136	Gene therapy based on gemcitabine chemosensitization suppresses pancreatic tumor growth.	Excepting surgical resection, there is no efficient treatment against pancreatic cancer. The chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine improves the patient's clinical status but survival is not prolonged. The aim of this study was to design a new strategy to render gemcitabine more efficient in the treatment of pancreatic cancer using gene therapy. We have generated a fusion gene (DCK::UMK) combining deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and uridine monophosphate kinase (UMK), which converts gemcitabine into its toxic phosphorylated metabolite. Antitumor effects of DCK::UMK gene expression were tested in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic transplantable model of pancreatic cancer established in hamsters. DCK::UMK sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine by reducing dramatically both in vitro cell viability and in vivo tumor volume. We found that in vivo expression of DCK::UMK resulted in an antitumor bystander effect due to apoptosis of untransduced cells. In vivo intratumoral gene transfer of DCK::UMK using the synthetic carrier PEI induced a potent tumor regression. Taken together, the results show that the fusion gene DCK::UMK sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment to induce cell death by apoptosis and tumor regression. Intratumoral delivery of the DCK::UMK gene in combination with gemcitabine might be of high interest for pancreatic cancer management.
17001291	A common polymorphism in the SCN1A gene associates with phenytoin serum levels at maintenance dose.	A broad range of phenytoin doses is used in clinical practice, with the final 'maintenance' dose normally determined by trial and error. A common functional polymorphism in the SCN1A gene (one of the genes encoding the drug target) has been previously associated with maximum dose of phenytoin used clinically, and also maximum dose of carbamazepine, another antiepileptic drug with the same drug target.
17003348	Imaging docking and fusion of insulin granules induced by antidiabetes agents: sulfonylurea and glinide drugs preferentially mediate the fusion of newcomer, but not previously docked, insulin granules.	Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, commonly used for antidiabetes therapies, are known to stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels. However, the specific actions of these drugs on insulin granule motion are largely unknown. Here, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to analyze the docking and fusion of single insulin granules in live beta-cells exposed to either the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide or the glinide drug mitiglinide. TIRF images showed that both agents caused rapid fusion of newcomer insulin granules with the cell membrane in both control and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat pancreatic beta-cells. However, in the context of beta-cells from sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) knockout mice, TIRF images showed that only mitiglinide, but not glibenclamide, caused fusion of newcomer insulin granules. Compositely, our data indicate that 1) the mechanism by which both sulfonylurea and glinide drugs promote insulin release entails the preferential fusion of newcomer, rather than previously docked, insulin granules, and that 2) mitiglinide can induce insulin release by a mechanism independent of mitiglinide binding to SUR1.
17015480	TReP-132 is a novel progesterone receptor coactivator required for the inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and enhancement of differentiation by progesterone.	The sex steroid progesterone is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland epithelium during pregnancy. In relation to this, in vitro studies using breast carcinoma T47D cells have demonstrated a biphasic progesterone response, consisting of an initial proliferative burst followed by a sustained growth arrest. However, the transcriptional factors acting with the progesterone receptor (PR) to mediate the progesterone effects on mammary cell growth and differentiation remain to be determined. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132), initially identified as a regulator of steroidogenesis, is also a cell growth suppressor. Similar to progesterone-bound PR, TReP-132 acts by inducing the gene expression of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 (p21) and p27Kip1 (p27). The putative interaction between TReP-132 and progesterone pathways in mammary cells was therefore analyzed in the present study. Our results show that TReP-132 interacts in vitro and in T47D cells with progesterone-activated PR. TReP-132 synergizes with progesterone-bound PR to trans activate the p21 and p27 gene promoters at proximal Sp1-binding sites. Moreover, TReP-132 overexpression and knockdown, respectively, increased or prevented the induction of p21 and p27 gene expression by progesterone. As a consequence, TReP-132 knockdown also resulted in the loss of the inhibitory effects of progesterone on pRB phosphorylation, G1/S cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the knockdown of TReP-132 expression also prevented the induction of both early and terminal markers of breast cell differentiation which had been previously identified as progesterone target genes. As well, the progesterone-induced accumulation of lipid vacuoles was inhibited in the TReP-132-depleted cells. Finally, TReP-132 gene expression levels increased following progesterone treatment, indicating the existence of a positive auto-regulatory loop between PR and TReP-132. Taken together, these data identify TReP-132 as a coactivator of PR mediating the growth-inhibitory and differentiation effects of progesterone on breast cancer cells.
17020465	Novel vasopressin type 2 (AVPR2) gene mutations in Brazilian nephrogenic diabetes insipidus patients.	Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is an inherited disorder characterized by renal resistance to the antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP), resulting in polyuria, polydipsia, and hypoosmolar urine. In the vast majority of cases, NDI is associated with germ-line mutations in the vasopressin receptor type 2 gene (AVPR2) and in about 8% of the cases with the water channel aquaporin-2 gene (AQP-2) mutations. To date, approximately 277 families with 185 germ-line mutations in the AVPR2 gene have been described worldwide. In the present study, the AVPR2 gene was genotyped in eight unrelated Brazilian kindred with NDI. In five of these NDI families, novel mutations were noted (S54R, I130L, S187R, 219delT, and R230P), whereas three seemingly unrelated probands were found to harbor previously described AVPR2 gene mutations (R106C, R137H, R337X). Additionally a novel polymorphism (V281V) was detected. In conclusion, although NDI is a rare disease, the findings of mutations scattered over the entire coding region of the AVPR2 gene are a valuable model to determine structure function relationship in G-protein-coupled receptor related diseases. Furthermore, our data indicate that in Brazil the spectrum of AVPR2 gene mutations is "family specific".
17023504	Effects of flecainide and quinidine on arrhythmogenic properties of Scn5a+/Delta murine hearts modelling long QT syndrome 3.	Long QT3 (LQT3) syndrome is associated with incomplete Na+ channel inactivation, abnormal repolarization kinetics and prolonged cardiac action potential duration (APD). Electrophysiological effects of flecainide and quinidine were compared in Langendorff-perfused wild-type (WT), and genetically modified (Scn5a+/Delta) murine hearts modelling LQT3. Extra stimuli (S2) following trains of pacing stimuli (S1) applied to the right ventricular epicardium triggered ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 16 out of 28 untreated Scn5a+/Delta and zero out of 12 WT hearts. Paced electrogram fractionation analysis then demonstrated increased electrogram durations (EGD), expressed as EGD ratios, in arrhythmogenic Scn5a+/Delta hearts, and prolonged ventricular effective refractory periods in initially non-arrhythmogenic Scn5a+/Delta hearts. Nevertheless, comparisons of epicardial and endocardial monophasic action potential recordings demonstrated negative transmural repolarization gradients in both groups, giving DeltaAPD(90) values at 90% repolarization of -20.88 +/- 1.93 ms (n = 11) and -16.91 +/- 1.43 ms (n = 23), respectively. Flecainide prevented initiation of VT in 13 out of 16 arrhythmogenic Scn5a+/Delta hearts, reducing EGD ratio and restoring DeltaAPD90 to + 7.55 +/- 2.24 ms (n = 9) (P < 0.05). VT occurred in four out of eight non-arrhythmogenic Scn5a+/Delta hearts in the presence of quinidine, which increased EGD ratio but left DeltaAPD90 unchanged. In contrast (P < 0.05), WT hearts had positive DeltaAPD90 values (+ 11.72 +/- 2.17 ms) (n = 20). Flecainide then increased arrhythmic tendency and EGD ratio but conserved DeltaAPD90; reduced EGD ratios and unaltered DeltaAPD90 values accompanied the lower arrhythmogenicity associated with quinidine treatment. In addition to the changes in EGD ratio shown by WT hearts, these findings attribute arrhythmogenesis and its modification by flecainide and quinidine to alterations in DeltaAPD90 in Scn5a+/Delta hearts. This is consistent with a hypothesis in which incomplete Na+ channel inactivation in Scn5a+/Delta hearts generates functional substrates dependent on altered refractoriness that cause abnormalities in activation and conduction of subsequent cardiac impulses. Any spatial heterogeneities between the epicardial and endocardial layers would thus cause fragmentation of the activation wavefront and contribute to electrogram spreading.
17023534	An orally active selective androgen receptor modulator is efficacious on bone, muscle, and sex function with reduced impact on prostate.	A number of conditions, including osteoporosis, frailty, and sexual dysfunction in both men and women have been improved using androgens. However, androgens are not widely used for these indications because of the side effects associated with these drugs. We describe an androgen receptor (AR) ligand that maintains expected anabolic activities with substantially diminished activity in the prostate. LGD2226 is a nonsteroidal, nonaromatizable, highly selective ligand for the AR, exhibiting virtually no affinity for the other intracellular receptors. We determined that AR bound to LGD2226 exhibits a unique pattern of protein-protein interactions compared with testosterone, fluoxymesterone (an orally available steroidal androgen), and other steroids, suggesting that LGD2226 alters the conformation of the ligand-binding domain. We demonstrated that LGD2226 is fully active in cell-based models of bone and muscle. LGD2226 exhibited anabolic activity on muscle and bone with reduced impact on prostate growth in rodent models. Biomechanical testing of bones from animals treated with LGD2226 showed strong enhancement of bone strength above sham levels. LGD2226 was also efficacious in a sex-behavior model in male rats measuring mounts, intromissions, ejaculations, and copulation efficiency. These results with an orally available, nonaromatizable androgen demonstrate the important role of the AR and androgens in mediating a number of beneficial effects in bone, muscle, and sexual function independent from the conversion of androgens into estrogenic ligands. Taken together, these results suggest that orally active, nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators may be useful therapeutics for enhancing muscle, bone, and sexual function.
17038430	Protection conferred by myocardial ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pressure overload-induced congestive heart failure revealed in KCNJ11 Kir6.2-null mutant.	Ventricular load can precipitate development of the heart failure syndrome, yet the molecular components that control the cardiac adaptive response to imposed demand remain partly understood. Compromised ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel function renders the heart vulnerable to stress, implicating this metabolic sensor in the homeostatic response that would normally prevent progression of cardiac disease. Here, pressure overload was imposed on the left ventricle by transverse aortic constriction in the wild-type and in mice lacking sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels through Kir6.2 pore knockout (Kir6.2-KO). Despite equivalent haemodynamic loads, within 30 min of aortic constriction, Kir6.2-KO showed an aberrant prolongation of action potentials with intracellular calcium overload and ATP depletion, whereas wild-type maintained ionic and energetic handling. On catheterization, constricted Kir6.2-KO displayed compromised myocardial performance with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, not seen in the wild-type. Glyburide, a K(ATP) channel inhibitor, reproduced the knockout phenotype in the wild-type, whereas the calcium channel antagonist, verapamil, prevented abnormal outcome in Kir6.2-KO. Within 48 h following aortic constriction, fulminant biventricular congestive heart failure, characterized by exercise intolerance, cardiac contractile dysfunction, hepatopulmonary congestion and ascites, halved the Kir6.2-KO cohort, while no signs of organ failure or mortality were seen in wild-type. Surviving Kir6.2-KO developed premature and exaggerated fibrotic myocardial hypertrophy associated with nuclear up-regulation of calcium-dependent pro-remodelling MEF2 and NF-AT pathways, precipitating chamber dilatation within 3 weeks. Thus, K(ATP) channels appear mandatory in acute and chronic cardiac adaptation to imposed haemodynamic load, protecting against congestive heart failure and death.
17038445	Role of glucocorticoid receptor in acclimation of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) to seawater and effects of arsenic.	Killifish are euryhaline teleosts that adapt to rapid changes in the salinity of the seawater. It is generally accepted that acclimation to seawater is mediated by cortisol activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which stimulates CFTR mRNA expression and CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion by the gill. Because there is no direct evidence in killifish that the GR stimulates CFTR gene expression, quantitative PCR studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that cortisol activation of GR upregulates CFTR mRNA expression and that this response is required for acclimation to seawater. Inhibition of the GR by RU-486 prevented killifish from acclimating to increased salinity and blocked the increase in CFTR mRNA. In contrast, inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor by spironolactone had no effect on acclimation to seawater. Thus acclimation to increased salinity in killifish requires signaling via the GR and includes an increase in CFTR gene expression. Because arsenic, a toxic metalloid that naturally occurs in the aquatic environment, has been shown to disrupt GR transcriptional regulation in avian and mammalian systems, studies were also conducted to determine whether arsenic disrupts cortisol-mediated activation of CFTR gene expression in this in vivo fish model and thereby blocks the ability of killifish to acclimate to increased salinity. Arsenic prevented acclimation to seawater and decreased CFTR protein abundance. However, arsenic did not disrupt the GR-induced increase in CFTR mRNA. Thus arsenic blocks acclimation to seawater in killifish by a mechanism that does not disrupt GR-mediated induction of CFTR gene expression.
17053162	Recovery of mucosal barrier function in ischemic porcine ileum and colon is stimulated by a novel agonist of the ClC-2 chloride channel, lubiprostone.	Previous studies utilizing an ex vivo porcine model of intestinal ischemic injury demonstrated that prostaglandin (PG)E(2) stimulates repair of mucosal barrier function via a mechanism involving Cl(-) secretion and reductions in paracellular permeability. Further experiments revealed that the signaling mechanism for PGE(2)-induced mucosal recovery was mediated via type-2 Cl(-) channels (ClC-2). Therefore, the objective of the present study was to directly investigate the role of ClC-2 in mucosal repair by evaluating mucosal recovery in ischemia-injured intestinal mucosa treated with the selective ClC-2 agonist lubiprostone. Ischemia-injured porcine ileal mucosa was mounted in Ussing chambers, and short-circuit current (I(sc)) and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) were measured in response to lubiprostone. Application of 0.01-1 microM lubiprostone to ischemia-injured mucosa induced concentration-dependent increases in TER, with 1 microM lubiprostone stimulating a twofold increase in TER (DeltaTER = 26 Omega.cm(2); P < 0.01). However, lubiprostone (1 microM) stimulated higher elevations in TER despite lower I(sc) responses compared with the nonselective secretory agonist PGE(2) (1 microM). Furthermore, lubiprostone significantly (P < 0.05) reduced mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of (3)H-labeled mannitol to levels comparable to those of normal control tissues and restored occludin localization to tight junctions. Activation of ClC-2 with the selective agonist lubiprostone stimulated elevations in TER and reductions in mannitol flux in ischemia-injured intestine associated with structural changes in tight junctions. Prostones such as lubiprostone may provide a selective and novel pharmacological mechanism of accelerating recovery of acutely injured intestine compared with the nonselective action of prostaglandins such as PGE(2).
17056009	hERG K+ channel blockade by the antipsychotic drug thioridazine: An obligatory role for the S6 helix residue F656.	The phenothiazine antipsychotic agent thioridazine has been linked with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Although thioridazine is known to inhibit cardiac hERG K(+) channels there is little mechanistic information on this action. We have investigated in detail hERG K(+) channel current (I(hERG)) blockade by thioridazine and identified a key molecular determinant of blockade. Whole-cell I(hERG) measurements were made at 37 degrees C from human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells expressing wild-type and mutant hERG channels. Thioridazine inhibited I(hERG) tails at -40mV following a 2s depolarization to +20mV with an IC(50) value of 80nM. Comparable levels of I(hERG) inhibition were seen with physiological command waveforms (ventricular and Purkinje fibre action potentials). Thioridazine block of I(hERG) was only weakly voltage-dependent, though the time dependence of I(hERG) inhibition indicated contingency of blockade upon channel gating. The S6 helix point mutation F656A almost completely abolished, and the Y652A mutation partially attenuated, I(hERG) inhibition by thioridazine. In summary, thioridazine is one of the most potent hERG K(+) channel blockers amongst antipsychotics, exhibiting characteristics of a preferential open/activated channel blocker and binding at a high affinity site in the hERG channel pore.
17062688	Bcl-2 expression as a predictive marker of hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with taxane-based chemotherapy.	Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, and its overexpression is associated with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Bak and Bax are in the Bcl-2 family and counteract the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2. Taxane-induced (paclitaxel and its analogue docetaxel) phosphorylation of Bcl-2 abolishes the potential antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2. We hypothesized that (a) survival benefit in HRPC patients treated with taxanes is determined by the presence of Bcl-2 protein and (b) altered expression of Bak and Bax protein caused by genetic mutation is associated with biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer.
17063156	Tolcapone improves cognition and cortical information processing in normal human subjects.	Prefrontal cortical dopamine (DA) regulates various executive cognitive functions, including attention and working memory. Efforts to enhance prefrontal-related cognition, which have focused on catecholaminergic stimulant drugs, have been unsatisfactory. Recently, the demonstration that a functional polymorphism in the catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene impacts prefrontal cognition raises the possibility of a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of prefrontal lobe executive dysfunction. To explore in a proof of concept study the effects of tolcapone, a CNS penetrant specific COMT inhibitor, we performed a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, and crossover design of this drug in normal subjects stratified by COMT (val158met) genotype. COMT enzyme activity was determined in peripheral blood. Forty-seven normal volunteers with no family history of psychiatric disorders underwent neuropsychological testing and 34 of those subjects underwent physiological measurement of prefrontal information processing assessed by blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found significant drug effects on measures of executive function and verbal episodic memory and a significant drug by genotype interaction on the latter, such that individuals with val/val genotypes improved, whereas individuals with met/met genotypes worsened on tolcapone. fMRI revealed a significant tolcapone-induced improvement in the efficiency of information processing in prefrontal cortex during a working memory test. This study demonstrates enhancement of prefrontal cortical function in normal human subjects with a nonstimulant drug having COMT inhibitory activity. Our results are consistent with data from animal studies and from computational models of the effects of selective enhancement of DA signaling in the prefrontal cortex.
17065054	Micro-array analysis of resistance for gemcitabine results in increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase subunits.	To study in detail the relation between gene expression and resistance against gemcitabine, a cell line was isolated from a tumor for which gemcitabine resistance was induced in vivo. Similar to the in vivo tumor, resistance in this cell line, C 26-G, was not related to deficiency of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). Micro-array analysis showed increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunits M1 and M2 as confirmed by real time PCR analysis (28- and 2.7-fold, respectively). In cell culture, moderate cross-resistance (about 2-fold) was observed to 1-ss-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), 2-chloro-2'deoxyadenosine (CdA), LY231514 (ALIMTA), and cisplatin (CDDP), and pronounced cross-resistance (>23-fold) to 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyguanosine (dFdG). Culture in the absence of gemcitabine reduced resistance as well as RRM1 RNA expression, demonstrating a direct relationship of RRM1 RNA expression with acquired resistance to gemcitabine.
17068198	Signaling complexes associated with the type I gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor: colocalization of extracellularly regulated kinase 2 and GnRH receptor within membrane rafts.	Our previous work demonstrated that the type I GnRH receptor (GnRHR) resides exclusively and constitutively within membrane rafts in alphaT3-1 gonadotropes and that this association was necessary for the ability of the receptor to couple to the ERK signaling pathway. G(alphaq), c-raf, and calmodulin have also been shown to reside in this compartment, implicating a raft-associated multiprotein signaling complex as a functional link between the GnRHR and ERK signaling. In the studies reported here, we used subcellular fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation to analyze the behavior of ERKs with respect to this putative signaling platform. ERK 2 associated partially and constitutively with low-density membranes both in alphaT3-1 cells and in whole mouse pituitary. Cholesterol depletion of alphaT3-1 cells reversibly blocked the association of both the GnRHR and ERKs with low-density membranes and uncoupled the ability of GnRH to activate ERK. Analysis of the kinetics of recovery of ERK inducibility after cholesterol normalization supported the conclusion that reestablishment of the association of the GnRHR and ERKs with the membrane raft compartment was not sufficient for reconstitution of signaling activity. In alphaT3-1 cells, the GnRHR and ERK2 coimmunoprecipitated from low-density membrane fractions prepared either in the presence or absence of detergent. The GnRHR also partitioned into low-density, detergent-resistant membrane fractions in mouse pituitary and coimmunoprecipitated with ERK2 from these fractions. Collectively, these data support a model in which coupling of the GnRHR to the ERK pathway in gonadotropes involves the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex in association with specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane.
17068342	Spatial expression patterns and biochemical properties distinguish a second myo-inositol monophosphatase IMPA2 from IMPA1.	Lithium is used in the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder, a disease where patients suffer mood swings between mania and depression. Although the mode of action of lithium remains elusive, a putative primary target is thought to be inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) activity. Two IMPase genes have been identified in mammals, the well characterized myo-inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) and myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMPA2). Several lines of genetic evidence have implicated IMPA2 in the pathogenesis of not only bipolar disorder but also schizophrenia and febrile seizures. However, little is known about the protein, although it is predicted to have lithium-inhibitable IMPase activity based on its homology to IMPA1. Here we present the first biochemical study comparing the enzyme activity of IMPA2 to that of IMPA1. We demonstrate that in vivo, IMPA2 forms homodimers but no heterodimers with IMPA1. Recombinant IMPA2 exhibits IMPase activity, although maximal activity requires higher concentrations of magnesium and a higher pH. IMPA2 shows significantly lower activity toward myo-inositol monophosphate than IMPA1. We therefore screened for additional substrates that could be more efficiently dephosphorylated by IMPA2, but failed to find any. Importantly, when using myo-inositol monophosphate as a substrate, the IMPase activity of IMPA2 was inhibited at high lithium and restricted magnesium concentrations. This kinetics distinguishes it from IMPA1. We also observed a characteristic pattern of differential expression between IMPA1 and IMPA2 in a selection of tissues including the brain, small intestine, and kidney. These data suggest that IMPA2 has a separate function in vivo from that of IMPA1.
17071728	A novel role of fibroblast growth factor-2 and pentosan polysulfate in the pathogenesis of intestinal bleeding in mice.	Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a heparin-like polysaccharide that can affect the binding interactions of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) with its high-affinity receptors. Patients with angiogenic tumors frequently show high levels of FGF-2 in the circulation. Since FGF-2 is a heparin-binding angiogenic growth factor, PPS has been used successfully to block its activity in patients with angiogenic tumors. However, because of its heparin-like activity, the major toxic effect of PPS is the development of bleeding disorders. The role that circulating FGF-2 plays in the pathogenesis of bleeding disorders in patients treated with PPS is currently unknown. Here we hypothesized that FGF-2 might play a physiological role in the pathogenesis of intestinal bleeding induced by PPS. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies showing that PPS is accumulated in the intestine and that circulating FGF-2 specifically binds to and modulates the angiogenic activity of intestinal submucosal endothelial cells. We used recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying a secreted form of FGF-2 and LacZ control vectors to determine whether high levels of circulating FGF-2 facilitate the development of intestinal bleeding disorders in FVB/N and C57BL/6J mice treated with PPS. We found that PPS, acting together with FGF-2, induced structural changes in intestinal vessels leading to the development of lethal intestinal hemorrhages. These findings might have wider clinical implications for the systemic use of PPS and other heparinoids in the treatment of patients with angiogenic diseases associated with high levels of circulating FGF-2.
17076770	Time-specific effects of perinatal glucocorticoid treatment on anterior pituitary morphology, annexin 1 expression and adrenocorticotrophic hormone secretion in the adult female rat.	Perinatal glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is increasingly associated with long-term disturbances in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical function. In the male rat, such treatment induces profound molecular, morphological and functional changes in the anterior pituitary gland at adulthood. To determine whether these effects are sex-specific, we have examined the effects of perinatal dexamethasone treatment on the female pituitary gland, focusing on (i) the integrity of the annexin 1 (ANXA1) dependent regulatory effects of GCs on adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release and (ii) corticotroph and folliculo-stellate (FS) cell morphology. Dexamethasone was given to pregnant (gestational days 16-19) or lactating (days 1-7 post partum) rats via the drinking water (1 microg/ml); controls received normal drinking water. Pituitary tissue from the female offspring was examined ex vivo at adulthood (60-90 days). Both treatment regimes reduced the intracellular and cell surface ANXA1 expression, as determined by western blot analysis and quantitative immunogold electron microscopic histochemistry. In addition, they compromised the ability of dexamethasone to suppress the evoked release of ACTH from the excised tissue in vitro, a process which requires the translocation of ANXA1 from the cytoplasm to the cell surface of FS cells. Although neither treatment regime affected the number of FS cells or corticotrophs, both altered the subcellular morphology of these cells. Thus, prenatal dexamethasone treatment increased while neonatal treatment decreased FS cell size and cytoplasmic area. By contrast, corticotroph size was unaffected by either treatment, as also was the size of the secretory granules. Corticotroph granule density and margination were, however, increased markedly by the prenatal treatment, while the neonatal treatment had no effect on granule density but decreased granule margination. Thus, perinatal dexamethasone treatment exerts long-term effects on the female pituitary gland, altering gene expression, cell morphology and the ANXA1-dependent GC regulation of ACTH secretion. The changes are similar but not identical to those reported in the male.
17083486	Activation of the Mitf promoter by lipid-stimulated activation of p38-stress signalling to CREB.	The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor Mitf plays a critical role in regulating many aspects of melanocyte biology. It is required for melanoblast and postnatal melanocyte survival, regulates proliferation, and activates genes associated with differentiation such as tyrosinase and related genes involved in melanogenesis. Identifying the signals that regulate Mitf expression is crucial if we are to understand how cells of the melanocyte lineage respond to environmental cues. Here we show that the Mitf promoter is induced by lipid signalling via the p38 stress-activated kinase pathway that is also activated by a wide range of receptors as well as UV irradiation. Signalling via p38 leads to increased phosphorylation and activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) that binds and activates the Mitf promoter via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element. Moreover, we also show that activation of p38 mediated by lipids is potentiated by inhibition of the PI3kinase pathway but not by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA). The results identify a mechanism in which stress signalling via p38 leads to activation of CREB, enhanced Mitf expression and consequently increased tyrosinase expression. The results are relevant for the regulation of melanocytes by Mitf, but also raise the possibility that lipid mediated activation of p38 signalling may represent a potential therapy for vitiligo.
17090651	Adaptive secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediates imatinib and nilotinib resistance in BCR/ABL+ progenitors via JAK-2/STAT-5 pathway activation.	Overcoming imatinib mesylate (IM) resistance and disease persistence in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is of considerable importance to the issue of potential cure. Here we asked whether autocrine signaling contributes to survival of BCR/ABL+ cells in the presence of IM and nilotinib (NI; AMN107), a novel, more selective Abl inhibitor. Conditioned media (CM) of IM-resistant LAMA84 cell clones (R-CM) was found to substantially protect IM-naive LAMA cells and primary CML progenitors from IM- or NI-induced cell death. This was due to an increased secretion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which was identified as the causative factor mediating IM resistance in R-CM. GM-CSF elicited IM and NI drug resistance via a BCR/ABL-independent activation of the janus kinases 2 (JAK-2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT-5) signaling pathway in GM-CSF receptor alpha receptor (CD116)-expressing cells, including primary CD34+/CD116+ GM progenitors (GMPs). Elevated mRNA and protein levels of GM-CSF were detected in IM-resistant patient samples, suggesting a contribution of GM-CSF secretion for IM and NI resistance in vivo. Importantly, inhibition of JAK-2 with AG490 abrogated GM-CSF-mediated STAT-5 phosphorylation and NI resistance in vitro. Together, adaptive autocrine secretion of GM-CSF mediates BCR/ABL-independent IM and NI resistance via activation of the antiapoptotic JAK-2/STAT-5 pathway. Inhibition of JAK-2 overcomes GM-CSF-induced IM and NI progenitor cell resistance, providing a rationale for the application of JAK-2 inhibitors to eradicate residual disease in CML.
17092607	Haloperidol induces neurotoxicity by the NMDA receptor downstream signaling pathway, alternative from glutamate excitotoxicity.	The NMDA receptor is believed to be important in a wide range of nervous system functions including neuronal migration, synapse formation, learning and memory. In addition, it is involved in excitotoxic neuronal cell death that occurs in a variety of acute and chronic neurological disorders. Besides of agonist/coagonist sites, other modulator sites, including butyrophenone site may regulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. It has been shown that haloperidol, an antipsychotic neuroleptic drug, interacts with the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor and inhibits NMDA response in neuronal cells. We found that NMDA receptor was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Ras antibody and this complex, beside NR2 subunit of NMDA receptor contained haloperidol-binding proteins, nNOS and Ras-GRF. Furthermore, we have shown that haloperidol induces neurotoxicity of neuronal cells via NMDA receptor complex, accompanied by dissociation of Ras-GRF from membranes and activation of c-Jun-kinase. Inclusion of insulin prevented relocalization of Ras-GRF and subsequent neuronal death. Haloperidol-induced dissociation of Ras-GRF leads to inhibition of membrane-bound form of Ras protein and changes downstream regulators activity that results in the initiation of the apoptotic processes via the mitochondrial way. Our results suggest that haloperidol induces neuronal cell death by the interaction with NMDA receptor, but through the alternative from glutamate excitotoxicity signaling pathway.
17101561	Detection of MTRR 66A-->G polymorphism using the real-time polymerase chain reaction machine LightCycler for determination of composition of allele after restriction cleavage.	The MTRR gene codes for methionine synthase reductase, one of the enzymes involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This conversion influences the overall level of total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) and mutations, which reduces the enzyme activity and results in an increased concentration of tHcy. A high homocysteine level is a well-documented independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A polymorphism in the gene for methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66 A>G) has been shown to be associated with the risk of giving birth to a child with Down's syndrome, and the risk of having a foetus with neural tube defects. We have established a method for analysing MTRR 66A>G on DNA from dried blood spots using melting temperature analysis. The DNA was extracted from dried blood spots using a fast procedure by boiling only.
17102120	Does the expression of c-kit (CD117) in neuroendocrine tumors represent a target for therapy?	Neuroendocrine tumors are very heterogeneous, develop from a variety of tissues, and can be difficult to diagnose. Without the clinical manifestation of metastases, it is often difficult to characterize them as malignant. Even so-called completely (R0) resected tumors can spread clinically visible metastases within a few months after initial surgery. Treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytoma are limited. Molecular targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors might prove to be helpful in patients with these tumors. In an immunohistochemical study, we examined KIT in 26 pheochromocytomas, 8 of which were malignant (3 adrenal pheochromocytomas, 5 paragangliomas). KIT expression was found in one of these 8 malignant tumors. This 2.5-cm-large adrenal pheochromocytoma originated from a woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 and spread into spine, skull, and lung. KIT expression could be demonstrated in 5% of tumor cells. On the basis of KIT expression immunohistochemically, we treated patients with neuroendocrine (i.e., medullary thyroid cancer) and other tumors with imatinib 400 mg per day, but without efficacy after 2 months of therapy. Similar results were shown by other investigators. Therefore, monotherapy with imatinib may not be efficacious in patients with neuroendocrine tumors that express KIT. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib that targets several receptors in addition to KIT may be more efficacious in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
17109827	Progesterone receptors activation after acute cocaine administration.	Cocaine modulates serum levels of progesterone in intact female and male rats, as well as in pregnant dams, and progesterone decreases or attenuates cocaine-induced behavioral and reward responses. It has been postulated that cocaine's modulation of serum progesterone levels may in turn alter progesterone receptor activity, thereby contributing to cocaine-induced alterations of neuronal functions and genomic regulations. To test this hypothesis, intact male rats received acute injections of saline or cocaine (15 or 30 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.9% saline, intraperitoneal). Progesterone serum levels, progesterone receptor (PR) protein levels, and PR-DNA binding complexes were measured in the striatum by radioimmunoassay, Western blot, and gel shift analyses, respectively. After injection of 15 mg/kg of cocaine, induction of progesterone serum levels was closely followed by an increase in receptor protein levels and DNA binding complexes. After injection of 30 mg/kg of cocaine, similar effects were observed along with an attenuation of receptor protein levels and DNA binding complexes at 60 min. Our results suggest that activation of progesterone receptors may be a mechanism by which cocaine mediates behavior through molecular alterations in the central nervous system.
17114825	Tryptamine induces tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase-mediated neurodegeneration with neurofibrillary tangles in human cell and mouse models.	The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other taupathies include neurofibrillary tangles and plaques. Despite the fact that only 2-10% of AD cases are associated with genetic mutations, no nontransgenic or metabolic models have been generated to date. The findings of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) in plaques of the AD brain were reported recently by the authors. Here it is shown that expression of cytoplasmic-TrpRS is inversely correlated with neurofibrillary degeneration, whereas a nonionic detergent-insoluble presumably aggregated TrpRS is simultaneously accumulated in human cells treated by tryptamine, a metabolic tryptophan analog that acts as a competitive inhibitor of TrpRS. TrpRSN- terminal peptide self-assembles in double-helical fibrils in vitro. Herein, tryptamine causes neuropathy characterized by motor and behavioral deficits, hippocampal neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloidosis, and glucose decrease in mice. Tryptamine induced the formation of helical fibrillary tangles in both hippocampal neurons and glia. Taken together with the authors' previous findings of tryptamine-induced nephrotoxicity and filamentous tangle formation in kidney cells, the authors' data indicates a general role of tryptamine in cell degeneration and loss. It is concluded that tryptamine as a component of a normal diet can induce neurodegeneration at the concentrations, which might be consumed along with food. Tryptophan-dependent tRNAtrp aminoacylation catalyzed by TrpRS can be inhibited by its substrate tryptophan at physiological concentrations was demonstrated. These findings indicate that the dietary supplementation with tryptophan as a tryptamine competitor may not counteract the deleterious influence of tryptamine. The pivotal role of TrpRS in protecting against neurodegeneration is suggested, providing an insight into the pathogenesis and a possible treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
17118173	Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and defects in uterine receptivity in women.	Endometriosis is a disorder that affects 5% of the normal population but is present in up to 40% of women with pelvic pain and/or infertility. Recent evidence suggests that the endometrium of women with endometriosis exhibits progesterone insensitivity. One endometrial protein that fluctuates in response to progesterone is the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), being down-regulated at the time of peak progesterone secretion during the window of implantation. Here we demonstrate that the biomarker of uterine receptivity, beta 3 integrin subunit, is reduced or absent in some women with endometriosis and that such defects are accompanied by inappropriate over-expression of ER alpha during the mid-secretory phase. Using a well-differentiated endometrial cell line we showed that the beta 3 integrin protein is negatively regulated by estrogen and positively regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF). By competing against estrogen with various selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and estrogen receptor agonists and antagonists, inhibition of expression of the beta 3 integrin by estrogen can be mitigated. In conclusion, we hypothesize that certain types of uterine receptivity defects may be caused by the loss of appropriate ER alpha down-regulation in the mid-secretory phase, leading to defects in uterine receptivity. Such changes might be effectively treated by timely administration of the appropriate anti-estrogens to artificially block ER alpha and restore normal patterns of gene expression. Such treatments will require further clinical studies.
17118432	Monitoring Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) therapy: which Anti-Factor Xa assay is appropriate?	Anti-Factor Xa (Anti-Xa) assays specifically determine the anticoagulant activity of UFH by measuring the ability of heparin-bound Antithrombin (AT) to inhibit a single enzyme, Factor Xa (FXa). Recent improvements in the automation, cost-effectiveness and accessibility of the assay to clinicians, have resulted in the Anti-Xa assay becoming a part of daily clinical practice in many institutions.
17130456	Neutron diffraction studies of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase complexed with methotrexate.	Hydrogen atoms play a central role in many biochemical processes yet are difficult to visualize by x-ray crystallography. Spallation neutron sources provide a new arena for protein crystallography with TOF measurements enhancing data collection efficiency and allowing hydrogen atoms to be located in smaller crystals of larger biological macromolecules. Here we report a 2.2-A resolution neutron structure of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in complex with methotrexate (MTX). Neutron data were collected on a 0.3-mm(3) D(2)O-soaked crystal at the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center. This study provides an example of using spallation neutrons to study protein dynamics, to identify protonation states directly from nuclear density maps, and to analyze solvent structure. Our structure reveals that the occluded loop conformation [monomer (mon.) A] of the DHFR.MTX complex undergoes greater H/D exchange compared with the closed-loop conformer (mon. B), partly because the Met-20 and beta(F-G) loops readily exchange in mon. A. The eight-stranded beta sheet of both DHFR molecules resists H/D exchange more than the helices and loops. However, the C-terminal strand, betaH, in mon. A is almost fully exchanged. Several D(2)Os form hydrogen bonds with exchanged amides. At the active site, the N1 atom of MTX is protonated and thus charged when bound to DHFR. Several D(2)Os are observed at hydrophobic surfaces, including two pockets near the MTX-binding site. A previously unidentified D(2)O hydrogen bonds with the catalytic D27 in mon. B, stabilizing its negative charge.
17131328	Involvement of ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit overexpression in gemcitabine resistance of human pancreatic cancer.	Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal of all solid tumors partially because of its chemoresistance. Although gemcitabine is widely used as a first selected agent for the treatment of this disease despite low response rate, molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer still remain obscure. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance. The 81-fold gemcitabine resistant variant MiaPaCa2-RG was selected from pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2. By microarray analysis between MiaPaCa2 and MiaPaCa2-RG, 43 genes (0.04%) were altered expression of more than 2-fold. The most upregulated gene in MiaPaCa2-RG was ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit (RRM1) with 4.5-fold up-regulation. Transfection with RRM1-specific RNAi suppressed more than 90% of RRM1 mRNA and protein expression. After RRM1-specific RNAi transfection, gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG was reduced to the same level of MiaPaCa2. The 18 recurrent pancreatic cancer patients treated by gemcitabine were divided into 2 groups by RRM1 levels. There was a significant association between gemcitabine response and RRM1 expression (p = 0.018). Patients with high RRM1 levels had poor survival after gemcitabine treatment than those with low RRM1 levels (p = 0.016). RRM1 should be a key molecule in gemcitabine resistance in human pancreatic cancer through both in vitro and clinical models. RRM1 may have the potential as predictor and modulator of gemcitabine treatment.
17134027	A feasibility study of [11C]SA4503-PET for evaluating sigmal receptor occupancy by neuroleptics: the binding of haloperidol to sigma1 and dopamine D2-like receptors.	We investigated feasibility of positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]SA4503 for evaluating the sigma1 receptor occupancy rate by neuroleptics. Haloperidol, which is well known to bind dopamine D2-like receptor (D2R) as well as to be a representative non-selective antagonist for sigma1 receptor (sigma1R), was selected as a model drug. Three healthy male subjects underwent 60-min [11C]raclopride-PET and 90-min [11C]SA4503-PET scans successively at a 120-min interval twice in a day for baseline measurement and on another day for haloperidol-loading measurement 16 hours after peroral administration of 3 mg of haloperidol. Binding potential (BP) of [11C]raclopride and [11C]SA4503 was quantitatively evaluated and the sigma1R and D2R occupancy rates were determined. D2R occupancy rates by haloperidol were 64% and 62% in the caudate and putamen, respectively, 16 h after the administration, while sigma1R occupancy rates were approximately 80% in all seven regions investigated including the caudate, putamen and cerebellum 18 h after the administration, suggesting that the sigma1R receptor occupancy rate by haloperidol was slightly larger than the D2R receptor occupancy rate. We concluded that [11C]SA4503-PET can be used for evaluating the sigma1R occupancy rates by neuroleptics or other drugs.
17137369	Synthesis of methylene- and difluoromethylenephosphonate analogues of uridine-4-phosphate and 3-deazauridine-4-phosphate.	Cytidine triphosphate synthetase (CTPS) catalyzes the formation of cytidine triphosphate from glutamine, uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP), and adenosine-5'-triphosphate. Inhibitors of CTPS are of interest because of their potential as therapeutic agents. One approach to potent enzyme inhibitors is to use analogues of high energy intermediates formed during the reaction. The CTPS reaction proceeds via the high energy intermediate UTP-4-phosphate (UTP-4-P). Four novel analogues of uridine-4-phosphate (U-4-P) and 3-deazauridine-4-phosphate (3-deazaU-4-P) were synthesized in which the labile phosphate ester oxygen was replaced with a methylene and difluoromethylene group. The methylene analogue of U-4-P, compound 1, was prepared by a reaction of the sodium salt of tert-butyl diethylphosphonoacetate with protected, 4-O-activated uridine followed by acetate deprotection and decarboxylation. It was found that this compound undergoes relatively facile dephosphonylation presumably via a metaphosphate intermediate. The difluoromethylene derivative, compound 2, was prepared by electrophilic fluorination of protected 1. This compound was stable and did not undergo dephosphonylation. Synthesis of the methylene analogue of 3-deazaU-4-P, compound 3, was achieved by ribosylation of protected 4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-hydroxypyridine. Electrophilic fluorination was also employed in the preparation of protected 4-(phosphonodifluoromethyl)-2-hydroxypyridine which was used as the key building block in the synthesis of difluoro derivative 4. These compounds represent the first examples of a nucleoside in which the base has been chemically modified with a methylene or difluormethylenephosphonate group.
17155953	Inhibition of the platelet P2Y12 receptor for adenosine diphosphate potentiates the antiplatelet effect of prostacyclin.	Activation of two receptors for adenosine diphosphate (ADP), P2Y(1) and P2Y(12), is necessary for ADP-induced platelet aggregation (PA). It is generally believed that the antithrombotic effects of drugs inhibiting P2Y(12), such as clopidogrel, are uniquely mediated by inhibition of P2Y(12)-dependent PA. However, as P2Y(12) is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC), its inhibition may also exert antithrombotic effects through the potentiation of prostacyclin (PGI(2)), which inhibit PA by stimulating AC.
17158208	Expression and externalization of annexin 1 in the adrenal gland: structure and function of the adrenal gland in annexin 1-null mutant mice.	Annexin 1 (ANXA1) is a member of the annexin family of phospholipid- and calcium-binding proteins with a well demonstrated role in early delayed (30 min to 3 h) inhibitory feedback of glucocorticoids in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This study used adrenal gland tissue from ANXA1-null transgenic mice, in which a beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) reporter gene was controlled by the ANXA1 promoter, and wild-type control mice to explore the potential role of ANXA1 in adrenal function. RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed strong expression of ANXA1 mRNA and protein in the adrenal gland. Immunofluorescence labeling of ANXA1 in wild-type and beta-Gal expression in ANXA1-null adrenals localized intense staining in the outer perimeter cell layers. Immunogold electron microscopy identified cytoplasmic and nuclear ANXA1 labeling in outer cortical cells and capsular cells. Exposure of adrenal segments in vitro to dexamethasone (0.1 mum, 3 h) caused an increase in the amount of ANXA1 in the intracellular compartment and attached to the surface of the cells. The N-terminal peptide ANXA1(Ac2-26) inhibited corticosterone release. Corticosterone release was significantly greater from ANXA1-null adrenal cells compared with wild type in response to ACTH (10 pm to 5 nm). In contrast, basal and ACTH-stimulated aldosterone release from ANXA1-null adrenal cells was not different from wild type. Morphometry studies demonstrated that ANXA1 null adrenal glands were smaller than wild-type, and the cortical/medullary area ratio was significantly reduced. These results suggest ANXA1 is a regulator of adrenocortical size and corticosterone secretion.
17158446	Lysyl-tRNA synthetase-generated lysyl-adenylate is a substrate for histidine triad nucleotide binding proteins.	Histidine triad nucleotide binding proteins (Hints) are the most ancient members of the histidine triad protein superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases and hydrolyases. Protein-protein interaction studies have found that complexes of the transcription factors MITF or USF2 and lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) are associated with human Hint1. Therefore, we hypothesized that lysyl-AMP or the LysRS.lysyl-AMP may be a native substrate for Hints. To explore the biochemical relationship between Hint1 and LysRS, a series of catalytic radiolabeling, mutagenesis, and kinetic experiments was conducted with purified LysRSs and Hints from human and Escherichia coli. After incubation of the E. coli or human LysRS with Hints and [alpha-(32)P]ATP, but not [alpha-(32)P]GTP, (32)P-labeled Hints were observed. By varying time and the concentrations of lysine, Mg(2+), or LysRS, the adenylation of Hint was found to be dependent on the formation of lysyl-AMP. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the active site histidine triad revealed that Hint labeling could be abolished by substitution of either His-101 of E. coli hinT or His-112 of human Hint1 by either alanine or glycine. Ap(4)A, believed to be synthesized by LysRS in vivo, and Zn(2+) were shown to inhibit the formation of Hint-AMP with an IC(50) value in the low micromolar range. Consistent with pyrophosphate being an inhibitor for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, incubations in the presence of pyrophosphatase resulted in enhanced formation of Hint-AMP. These results demonstrate that the lysyl-AMP intermediate formed by LysRS is a natural substrate for Hints and suggests a potential highly conserved regulatory role for Hints on LysRS and possibly other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
17158759	Tamoxifen-induced ER-alpha-SRC-3 interaction in HER2 positive human breast cancer; a possible mechanism for ER isoform specific recurrence.	Differential signalling between the two oestrogen receptor (ER) isoforms in the presence of tamoxifen has been described. We hypothesise that differential recruitment of the steroid receptor co-activator, SRC-3 to ER-alpha and ER-beta may in part explain associations between ER isoforms and response to endocrine treatment. SRC-3 was localised within epithelial cells of breast tumour tissue and was co-localised with ER-alpha and ER-beta, (n=112). Expression of SRC-3 was found to be positively associated with ER-alpha (P=0.0021) and inversely with ER-beta (P<0.0001). Uniquely, this study utilises primary cell cultures derived from patient tumours, thus providing samples not readily available in most molecular model systems. These samples have enabled us to investigate the influence of growth factor pathways on steroid receptor-co-activator interactions. In HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) positive primary tumour cell cultures 17beta-estradiol induced a decrease in SRC-3, whereas upregulated SRC-3 expression. Furthermore, treatment with tamoxifen-induced SRC-3 recruitment to the ER-oestrogen response element and enhanced interaction between SRC-3 and ER-alpha, but not ER-beta. Knockdown of SRC-3 results in a concomitant loss of expression of the oestrogen target gene pS2. Furthermore, silencing of SRC-3 resensitizes endocrine resistant, HER2 positive cells to the anti-proliferative effects of tamoxifen. The ability of ER-alpha, but not ER-beta to recruit SRC-3 in the presence of tamoxifen may in part explain the differential ER isoform associations with recurrence in human breast cancer.
17175104	Acetaminophen selectively suppresses peripheral prostaglandin E2 release and increases COX-2 gene expression in a clinical model of acute inflammation.	Acetaminophen is widely used for pain management as an alternative to NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors, but its action at a molecular level is still unclear. We evaluated acetaminophen's effect on PG release and the expression patterns of genes related to PG production in a clinical model of tissue injury and acute inflammation. Subjects (119 outpatients) received either 1000 mg acetaminophen, 50 mg rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor), 30 mg ketorolac (a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor), or placebo before the surgical removal of two impacted mandibular third molars. Microdialysis was used to collect inflammatory transudate from the surgical site for measurement of PGE2 and TXB2 levels at the site of injury. Biopsies were collected to investigate the expression patterns of genes related to PG production at baseline prior to surgery and at 3 or 24 h following surgery. PGE2 release was suppressed by ketorolac, rofecoxib and acetaminophen compared to placebo at 3 h coincident with increased COX-2 gene expression in biopsies collected from the surgical site. TXB2 release was suppressed only by ketorolac. COX-2 gene expression remained elevated at 24 h with continued ketorolac and acetaminophen treatment. COX-1 gene expression was significantly down-regulated at 24 h by ketorolac, rofecoxib and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen suppression of PGE2 without inhibiting TXB2 release, when COX-2 gene expression is up-regulated, suggests that acetaminophen is a selective COX-2 inhibitor in vivo. The up-regulation of COX-2 gene and down-regulation of COX-1 gene expression suggests that acetaminophen may result in changes in COX-derived prostanoids with repeated doses.
17178882	Sorafenib blocks the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, inhibits tumor angiogenesis, and induces tumor cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma model PLC/PRF/5.	Angiogenesis and signaling through the RAF/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK cascade have been reported to play important roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against Raf kinase and several receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), FLT3, Ret, and c-Kit. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of sorafenib on PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 HCC cells and the in vivo antitumor efficacy and mechanism of action on PLC/PRF/5 human tumor xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Sorafenib inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK and down-regulated cyclin D1 levels in these two cell lines. Sorafenib also reduced the phosphorylation level of eIF4E and down-regulated the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in a MEK/ERK-independent manner. Consistent with the effects on both MEK/ERK-dependent and MEK/ERK-independent signaling pathways, sorafenib inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in both HCC cell lines. In the PLC/PRF/5 xenograft model, sorafenib tosylate dosed at 10 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth by 49%. At 30 mg/kg, sorafenib tosylate produced complete tumor growth inhibition. A dose of 100 mg/kg produced partial tumor regressions in 50% of the mice. In mechanism of action studies, sorafenib inhibited the phosphorylation of both ERK and eIF4E, reduced the microvessel area (assessed by CD34 immunohistochemistry), and induced tumor cell apoptosis (assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling) in PLC/PRF/5 tumor xenografts. These results suggest that the antitumor activity of sorafenib in HCC models may be attributed to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR and PDGFR) and direct effects on tumor cell proliferation/survival (Raf kinase signaling-dependent and signaling-independent mechanisms).
17181139	Scaffold of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor carprofen provides Alzheimer gamma-secretase modulators.	N-sulfonylated and N-alkylated carprofen derivatives were investigated for their inhibition and modulation of gamma-secretase, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The introduction of a lipophilic substituent transformed the COX-2 inhibitor carprofen into a potent gamma-secretase modulator. Several compounds (e.g., 9p, 11f) caused selective reduction of Abeta42 and an increase of Abeta38. The most active compounds displayed activities in the low micromolar range and no effect on the gamma-secretase cleavage at the e-site.
17184542	CHKA and PCYT1A gene polymorphisms, choline intake and spina bifida risk in a California population.	Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common of all human congenital defects. Over the last two decades, accumulating evidence has made it clear that periconceptional intake of folic acid can significantly reduce the risk of NTD affected pregnancies. This beneficial effect may be related to the ability of folates to donate methyl groups for critical physiological reactions. Choline is an essential nutrient and it is also a methyl donor critical for the maintenance of cell membrane integrity and methyl metabolism. Perturbations in choline metabolism in vitro have been shown to induce NTDs in mouse embryos.
17192772	VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes and phenprocoumon anticoagulation status: interaction between both genotypes affects dose requirement.	In a prospective follow-up study of the effects of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes on the anticoagulation status of patients, we assessed the CYP2C9 and the VKORC1 C1173T genotypes of patients during the initial 6 months of phenprocoumon treatment. We used linear regression models and Cox proportional hazard models to determine the effects of the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes on phenprocoumon dose requirements, overanticoagulation, and time to achieve stability. Allele frequencies of interest within the cohort (N=281) were 40.8% VKORC1 T-1173, 12.8% CYP2C9*2, and 6.9% CYP2C9*3. In patients with the VKORC1 CC genotype, carriers of a CYP2C9 polymorphism needed dosages that were nearly 30% lower than those for CYP2C9*1/*1 patients (P<0.001). In patients with a VKORC1 polymorphism, differences between carriers of a CYP2C9 polymorphism and CYP2C9*1/*1 were far smaller and largely not statistically significant. A larger part of the variability in dose requirement was explained by the VKORC1 genotype than by the CYP2C9 genotype (28.7% and 7.2%, respectively). Carriers of a combination of a CYP2C9 polymorphism and a VKORC1 polymorphism had a strongly increased risk of severe overanticoagulation (hazard ratio (HR) 7.20, P=0.002). Only carriers of a CYP2C9*2 allele had a decreased chance to achieve stability compared to CYP2C9*1/*1 patients (HR 0.61, P=0.004). In conclusion, the VKORC1 genotype modifies the effect of the CYP2C9 genotype on phenprocoumon dose requirements. A combination of polymorphisms of both genotypes is associated with a strongly increased risk of overanticoagulation, whereas delayed stabilization is mainly associated with the CYP2C9 genotype.
17199874	Heterogeneous effect of leucotriene CysLT1 receptor antagonists on antigen-induced motor and inflammatory responses in guinea-pig airways.	1. The effect of montelukast or MEN91507, selective leucotriene CysLT1 receptor antagonists, on antigen-induced airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction were compared in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. 2. In sensitized animals, ovalbumin (0.3 mg kg(-1), i.v.)-induced microvascular leakage in trachea, intrapulmonary airways, total lung (parenchyma and intrapulmonary airways) and urinary bladder was reduced by MEN91507 (0.01-1 micromol kg(-1), i.v.), whereas montelukast (0.01-1 micromol kg(-1), i.v.) antagonized the effect of the antigen only in the lung and urinary bladder. 3. Ovalbumin (1 mg kg(-1), i.v.)-induced bronchoconstriction was dose dependently antagonized by MEN91507 (10-30 micromol kg(-1), i.v.), whereas the effect of montelukast (0.1-30 micromol kg(-1), i.v.) was marginal (15-30% inhibition). Neither MEN91507 nor montelukast (30 micromol kg(-1), i.v.) affected the bronchoconstrictor response induced by acetylcholine (0.3 micromol kg(-1), i.v.) in sensitized animals. 4. It is concluded that montelukast and MEN91507 display a differential activity against the effect of endogenous leucotrienes, despite the fact that both compounds show a similar antagonist profile against exogenous leucotrienes acting through CysLT1 receptors.
17202402	Base excision repair proteins are required for integrin-mediated suppression of bleomycin-induced DNA breakage in murine lung endothelial cells.	Engagement of integrin cell adhesion receptors suppresses bleomycin (BLM)-induced DNA strand breakage in endothelial cells. Previous investigation of cells from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 knockout mice and with an inhibitor of the enzyme indicated that this facilitator of base excision repair (BER) is required for integrin-mediated suppression of DNA strand breakage. Here, small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) was used to assess the requirement for the BER proteins, DNA ligase III (Lig3) alpha, PARP-1, and X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 (XRCC1), and for the long-patch BER ligase, DNA ligase I (Lig1), in integrin-mediated protection from BLM-induced DNA breakage. Murine lung endothelial cells (MLECs) were transfected with siRNA, treated with anti-beta1 integrin antibody, and then BLM. 3'-OH in DNA and accumulation of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gammaH2AX), which reflects double-strand breakage, were measured. Integrin antibody inhibited the increases in 3'-OH caused by BLM in MLECs transfected with either control or Lig1 siRNA. However, after knockdown of Lig3alpha, PARP-1, or XRCC1, suppression of DNA breakage by integrin antibody was limited. BLM increased gammaH2AX levels, and integrin treatment inhibited this by 57 to 73% in MLECs transfected with control siRNA. Integrin engagement also inhibited increases in gammaH2AX in BLM-treated cells transfected with Lig1 siRNA. In contrast, Lig3alpha, PARP-1, and XRCC1 siRNAs prevented integrin-mediated inhibition of BLM-induced gammaH2AX levels. The results suggest that the BER proteins, Lig3alpha, PARP-1, and XRCC1, are required for integrin-mediated suppression of BLM-induced DNA breakage.
17212650	The Trace Amine 1 receptor knockout mouse: an animal model with relevance to schizophrenia.	Trace amines have been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. Although long known to modulate neurotransmission indirectly through the release of catecholamines, the identification of the Trace Amine 1 receptor (TA1) offers a mechanism by which trace amines can influence synaptic activity directly. TA1 binds and is activated by trace amines such as beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine. Our pharmacological characterization of mouse TA1 showed that, as in rat and primate, amphetamine is an agonist at this receptor but with surprisingly high potency. Without selective ligands for TA1 that do not also possess catecholamine-releasing properties, however, it has not been possible to study its physiological role in the central nervous system. To that end, a line of mice lacking the TA1 receptor was generated to characterize its contribution to the regulation of behavior. Compared with wild-type littermates, TA1 knockout (KO) mice displayed a deficit in prepulse inhibition. Knockout animals, in which the TA1-agonist influence of amphetamine was absent, showed enhanced sensitivity to the psychomotor-stimulating effect of this drug, which was temporally correlated with significantly larger increases in the release of both dopamine and norepinephrine in the dorsal striatum and associated with a 262% increase in the proportion of striatal high-affinity D2 receptors. TA1 therefore appears to play a modulatory role in catecholaminergic function and represents a potentially novel mechanism for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the TA1 KO mouse may provide a useful model for the development of treatments for some positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
17223989	Severe loss-of-function mutations in the adrenocorticotropin receptor (ACTHR, MC2R) can be found in patients diagnosed with salt-losing adrenal hypoplasia.	Familial glucocorticoid deficiency type I (FGD1) is a rare form of primary adrenal insufficiency resulting from recessive mutations in the ACTH receptor (MC2R, MC2R). Individuals with this condition typically present in infancy or childhood with signs and symptoms of cortisol insufficiency, but disturbances in the renin-angiotensin system, aldosterone synthesis or sodium homeostasis are not a well-documented association of FGD1. As ACTH stimulation has been shown to stimulate aldosterone release in normal controls, and other causes of hyponatraemia can occur in children with cortisol deficiency, we investigated whether MC2R changes might be identified in children with primary adrenal failure who were being treated for mineralocorticoid insufficiency.
17224717	Displacement of serotonin and dopamine transporters by venlafaxine extended release capsule at steady state: a [123I]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane single photon emission computed tomography imaging study.	Both positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies suggest that saturation of serotonin transporters (SERT) is present during treatment with therapeutic doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors also appear to increase the availability of dopamine transporters (DAT). The current study measured SERT occupancy and modulation of DAT by the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine using [123I]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane SPECT. Eight healthy subjects were administered open-label venlafaxine extended release capsules (75 mg/d for 4 days followed by 150 mg/d for 5 days). Venlafaxine significantly inhibited [123I]beta-CIT binding to SERT in the brainstem (55.4%) and the diencephalon (54.1%). In contrast, venlafaxine increased [123I]beta-CIT binding to DAT in the striatum (10.1%) after 5 days of administration of 150 mg/d. The displacement of [123I]beta-CIT from brain SERT and the increase in striatal [123I]beta-CIT binding to DAT appear similar to previous work with the SSRI citalopram (40 mg/d). A literature review of SERT occupancy by marketed SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine using SPECT ([123I]beta-CIT) or positron emission tomography ([11C](N, N-Dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio)-benzylamine) imaging suggests that therapeutic doses of SNRI are associated with virtual saturation of the serotonin transporter.
17226798	Association of the neuronal nicotinic receptor beta2 subunit gene (CHRNB2) with subjective responses to alcohol and nicotine.	Nicotine addiction and alcohol dependence are highly comorbid disorders that are likely to share overlapping genetic components. We have examined two neuronal nicotinic receptor subunit genes (CHRNA4 and CHRNB2) for possible associations with nicotine and alcohol phenotypes, including measures of frequency of use and measures of initial subjective response in the period shortly after first using the drugs. The subjects were 1,068 ethnically diverse young adults participating in ongoing longitudinal studies of adolescent drug behaviors at the University of Colorado, representing both clinical and community samples. Analysis of six SNPs in the CHRNA4 gene provided modest support for an association with past 6 month use of alcohol in Caucasians (three SNPs with P < 0.08), but no evidence for an association with tobacco and CHRNA4 was detected. However, a SNP (rs2072658) located immediately upstream of CHRNB2 was associated with the initial subjective response to both alcohol and tobacco. This study provides the first evidence for association between the CHRNB2 gene and nicotine- and alcohol-related phenotypes, and suggests that polymorphisms in CHRNB2 may be important in mediating early responses to nicotine and alcohol.
17230521	Anti-apoptotic role of TWIST and its association with Akt pathway in mediating taxol resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.	TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been reported to be associated with development and progression of human cancer. Recently, over expression of TWIST is found in cancer patients with shorter survival and poor response to chemotherapy. Previously, we found that upregulation of TWIST was responsible for the development of acquired resistance to taxol in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line, HNE1-T3 (Wang et al., Oncogene, 2004;24:274). In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the TWIST-mediated taxol resistance. By comparison of the parental HNE1 and its derivative HNE1-T3 cell lines, we found that the resistance to taxol in HNE1-T3 cells was associated with suppression of taxol-induced apoptosis evidenced by decreased expression of Bak and Bax and increased Bcl-2, as well as inhibition of PARP and caspase cleavage and DNA ladder formation. However, there was no correlation between taxol sensitivity and alterations on G2/M cell cycle distribution, suggesting that the TWIST-induced taxol resistance is mediated through protection against apoptosis but not mitotic arrest. Analysis of additional 8 NPC cell lines showed that upregulation of TWIST was associated with resistance to microtubule disrupting agents, especially taxol, and inactivation of TWIST through small RNA interference led to increased sensitivity to taxol-induced cell death. Subsequent studies also demonstrated that the TWIST-mediated taxol resistance may be regulated through its positive involvement with the Akt pathway. Our findings suggest an underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the TWIST-mediated chemodrug resistance and suggest a target for overcoming taxol resistance in cancer cells.
17234180	Metalloelastase (MMP-12) induced inflammatory response in mice airways: effects of dexamethasone, rolipram and marimastat.	Direct instillation of a recombinant human form of MMP-12 (rhMMP-12) in mice airways elicited an early inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil influx, cytokine release and gelatinase activation followed by a delayed response, mainly characterized by macrophage recruitment. As this experimental model of lung inflammation partially mimics some features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we have investigated the effects of treatment by anti-inflammatory compounds, dexamethasone and rolipram and a non-specific matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, marimastat. The compounds were administrated orally, 1 h before rhMMP-12 instillation (8 x 10(-3) U/mouse). Total and differential cell counts were evaluated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Cytokines and MMP-9 were quantified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and in lung homogenate supernatants. Marimastat (100 mg/kg), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) and rolipram (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) were able to decrease significantly neutrophil recruitment at 4 and 24 h after rhMMP-12 instillation, but only marimastat (30 and 100 mg/kg) was effective at decreasing the macrophage recruitment occurring at day 7. Marimastat (100 mg/kg), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) and rolipram (0.3 mg/kg) reduced significantly IL-6, KC/CXCL1, MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MMP-9 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Similar results were obtained in lung homogenates except with rolipram. Dexamethasone and rolipram were able to inhibit the early inflammatory response but were ineffective to limit the macrophage influx. In contrast, marimastat was able to reduce early and late response. These data indicate that MMP-12 instillation in mice could highlight some of the inflammatory response seen in COPD and could be used for the pharmacological evaluation of new anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action.
17234899	Trace amine-associated receptor 1 is a modulator of the dopamine transporter.	Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by a broad range of monoamines and amphetamine-related psychostimulants. Recent studies demonstrated wide distribution of TAAR1 in brain, coexpression of TAAR1 with dopamine transporter (DAT) in a subset of dopamine neurons in both mouse and rhesus monkey substantia nigra, and monoamine transporter-modulated activation. This study explored whether TAAR1 could influence DAT-mediated dopamine uptake and efflux. Rhesus monkey TAAR1 expressed with DAT in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was dose-dependently activated by dopamine or (+)-methamphetamine. This activation resulted in large cAMP increases and a transient reduction in [3H]dopamine accumulation within the cells, which was similar to the effect of dopamine D1 receptor (D1) or forskolin treatment. In addition, TAAR1 effects on dopamine uptake could be blocked by a protein kinase A or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. [3H]Dopamine efflux assays performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium displayed a TAAR1-dependent spontaneous [3H]dopamine efflux that was dose-dependently augmented by dopamine or (+)-methamphetamine and that was blocked by either methylphenidate or a PKC inhibitor. DAT cells in Krebs-HEPES buffer had an apparent spontaneous [3H]dopamine loss, but it could not be blocked by either methylphenidate or a PKC inhibitor. Taken together, this study provides evidence that TAAR1 is involved in functional regulation of DAT and suggests that TAAR1 is a potentially important target for therapeutics for methamphetamine addiction.
17234900	Rhesus monkey trace amine-associated receptor 1 signaling: enhancement by monoamine transporters and attenuation by the D2 autoreceptor in vitro.	Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that directly responds to endogenous monoamines as well as amphetamine-related psychostimulants, including methamphetamine. In the present study, we demonstrate TAAR1 mRNA and protein expression in rhesus monkey brain regions associated with monoaminergic systems, variable cellular distribution of TAAR1 in rhesus monkey brain, and TAAR1 coexpression with the dopamine transporter (DAT) in a subset of dopamine neurons in both rhesus monkey and mouse substantia nigra. On this basis, we evaluated rhesus monkey TAAR1 activation by different compounds and its functional relation with monoamine transporters and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2) short isoform (D2s) autoreceptor in vitro using a cAMP response element-luciferase assay. TAAR1 activation by monoamines and amphetamine-related compounds was greatly enhanced by coexpression of dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporters, and the activation enhancement was blocked by monoamine transporter inhibitors. This enhancement did not occur in control experiments in which the dopamine D1 receptor (D1) was substituted for TAAR1. Furthermore, activation of TAAR1 by dopamine was completely inhibited by D2s when coexpressed with TAAR1, and this inhibition was blocked by the D2 antagonist raclopride. Last, dopamine activation of TAAR1 could induce c-FOS-luciferase expression but only in the presence of DAT, whereas dopamine activation of D1 resulted in equivalent c-FOS expression in the presence or absence of DAT. Together, these data reveal a broad agonist spectrum for TAAR1, a functional relation of TAAR1 with monoamine transporters and D2s, and a mechanism by which D2 receptor drugs can influence brain monoaminergic function and have efficacy through affecting TAAR1 signaling.
17243824	Polyproline-rod approach to isolating protein targets of bioactive small molecules: isolation of a new target of indomethacin.	Identification of protein targets of bioactive small molecules has been a technical hurdle of chemical genetics. Here we report a polyproline-rod approach to isolating protein targets of small molecules from cell lysates. The results indicate that insertion of a long, rigid polyproline helix between a small-molecule bait and a biotin tag boosts the capacity of affinity purification and thereby permits isolation of low-abundance or low-affinity proteins. In the course of the proof-of-concept experiments, we isolated glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) as a new target of indomethacin, a widely used antiinflammatory drug. Molecular biological experiments suggest that inhibition of GLO1 enzyme activity is related to the clinically recognized beneficial side effects of the indomethacin family of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
17251911	A promoter haplotype of the inositol monophosphatase 2 gene (IMPA2) at 18p11.2 confers a possible risk for bipolar disorder by enhancing transcription.	Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder patients and its therapeutic effect may involve inhibition of inositol monophosphatase activity. In humans, the enzyme is encoded by two genes, IMPA1 and IMPA2. IMPA2 maps to 18p11.2, a genomic interval for which evidence of linkage to bipolar disorder has been supported by several reports. We performed a genetic association study in Japanese cohorts (496 patients with bipolar disorder and 543 control subjects). Interestingly, we observed association of IMPA2 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-461C and -207T) with bipolar disorder, the identical SNPs reported previously in a different population. In vitro promoter assay and genetic haplotype analysis showed that the combination of (-461C)-(-207T)-(-185A) drove enhanced transcription and the haplotypes containing (-461C)-(-207T)-(-185A) contributed to risk for bipolar disorder. Expression study on post-mortem brains revealed increased transcription from the IMPA2 allele that harbored (-461C)-(-207T)-(-185A) in the frontal cortex of bipolar disorder patients. The examination of allele-specific expressions in post-mortem brains did not support genomic imprinting of IMPA2, which was suggested nearby genomic locus. Contrasting to a prior report, therapeutic concentrations of lithium could not suppress the transcription of IMPA2 mRNA, and the mood-stabilizing effect of lithium is, if IMPA2 was one of the targets of lithium, deemed to be generated via inhibition of enzymatic reaction rather than transcriptional suppression. In conclusion, the present study suggests that a promoter haplotype of IMPA2 possibly contributes to risk for bipolar disorder by elevating IMPA2 levels in the brain, albeit the genetic effect varies among populations.
17258197	Interaction between cyclooxygenase (COX)-1- and COX-2-products modulates COX-2 expression in the late phase of acute inflammation.	Prostanoid production depends on the activity of two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms. It is appreciated that COX-1 plays a role in physiological processes, whereas COX-2 acts in pathological conditions. However their roles, particularly roles of COX-1, have not yet been fully established in inflammation. Here, we examined the effects of COX inhibitors, having differential isoform selectivity, on the late phase of rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy to elucidate the role of COX-2 expressed in the draining lymph nodes and found substantial contribution of COX-1-product(s). Protein and mRNA of COX-2 were detectable with Western blotting analysis and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in parathymic lymph nodes, peaking at 48 h after induction of pleurisy. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 was detectable by immunohistochemical analysis in cells with dendritic processes, a morphological characteristic similar to that of COX-2 expressing cells. Although aspirin, indomethacin and a COX-1 inhibitor, ketorolac, significantly decreased the volume of pleural exudate, they did not affect the levels of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in the lymph node 24 h after induction of pleurisy. In contrast, COX-2 inhibitors, nimesulide and NS-398, had no effect on the exudate volume, but they increased the number of COX-2- and mPGES-1-expressing cells and extension of their dendritic processes with significant increase in the COX-2 level, which were antagonised by ketorolac. These results suggest that COX-2-expressing cells may negatively self-regulate their functions by producing PGE2 via mPGES-1: migration into the draining lymph node and their differentiation. Moreover, COX-1- and COX-2-derived prostanoids may play differential or sometimes antagonistic roles in the late phase of acute inflammation.
17259370	Rosiglitazone inhibits acyl-CoA synthetase activity and fatty acid partitioning to diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-independent mechanism in human arterial smooth muscle cells and macrophages.	Rosiglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing agent that has recently been shown to exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis. In addition to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, rosiglitazone can affect other targets, such as directly inhibiting recombinant long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-4 activity. Because it is unknown if ACSL4 is expressed in vascular cells involved in atherosclerosis, we investigated the ability of rosiglitazone to inhibit ACSL activity and fatty acid partitioning in human and murine arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages. Human and murine SMCs and human macrophages expressed Acsl4, and rosiglitazone inhibited Acsl activity in these cells. Furthermore, rosiglitazone acutely inhibited partitioning of fatty acids into phospholipids in human SMCs and inhibited fatty acid partitioning into diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol in human SMCs and macrophages through a PPAR-gamma-independent mechanism. Conversely, murine macrophages did not express ACSL4, and rosiglitazone did not inhibit ACSL activity in these cells, nor did it affect acute fatty acid partitioning into cellular lipids. Thus, rosiglitazone inhibits ACSL activity and fatty acid partitioning in human and murine SMCs and in human macrophages through a PPAR-gamma-independent mechanism likely to be mediated by ACSL4 inhibition. Therefore, rosiglitazone might alter the biological effects of fatty acids in these cells and in atherosclerosis.
17260025	A chemical biology approach identifies a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes human tumor regression by blocking the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway.	A chemical biology approach identifies a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) agonist ARA-211 (Pirbuterol), which causes apoptosis and human tumor regression in animal models. beta2AR stimulation of cAMP formation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation leads to Raf-1 (but not B-Raf) kinase inactivation, inhibition of Mek-1 kinase and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 levels. ARA-211 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway is mediated by PKA and not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). ARA-211 is selective and suppresses P-Erk1/2 but not P-JNK, P-p38, P-Akt or P-STAT3 levels. beta2AR stimulation results in inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, induction of apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. beta2AR antagonists and constitutively active Mek-1 rescue from the effects of ARA-211, demonstrating that beta2AR stimulation and Mek kinase inhibition are required for ARA-211 antitumor activity. Furthermore, suppression of growth occurs only in human tumors where ARA-211 induces cAMP formation and decreases P-Erk1/2 levels. Thus, beta2AR stimulation results in significant suppression of malignant transformation in cancers where it blocks the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA but not EPAC.
17266941	Sorafenib alone or as combination therapy for growth control of cholangiocarcinoma.	Treatment options of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CC) are unsatisfactory and new therapeutic approaches are mandatory. Dysregulations of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway associated with proliferative advantages of tumors are commonly observed in CCs. The novel multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib potently suppresses the growth of various cancers by inhibiting kinases of wild-type B-Raf, mutant(V559E)B-Raf and C-Raf but its effects on CC remains to be explored. We therefore studied the antineoplastic potency of sorafenib in human CC cells alone and in combination with conventional cytostatics or IGF-1R inhibition.
17273558	Inhaled iloprost suppresses the cardinal features of asthma via inhibition of airway dendritic cell function.	Inhalation of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin (PGI(2)) analog, is a well-accepted and safe treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Although iloprost mainly acts as a vasodilator by binding to the I prostanoid (IP) receptor, recent evidence suggests that signaling via this receptor also has antiinflammatory effects through unclear mechanisms. Here we show in a murine model of asthma that iloprost inhalation suppressed the cardinal features of asthma when given during the priming or challenge phase. As a mechanism of action, iloprost interfered with the function of lung myeloid DCs, critical antigen-presenting cells of the airways. Iloprost treatment inhibited the maturation and migration of lung DCs to the mediastinal LNs, thereby abolishing the induction of an allergen-specific Th2 response in these nodes. The effect of iloprost was DC autonomous, as iloprost-treated DCs no longer induced Th2 differentiation from naive T cells or boosted effector cytokine production in primed Th2 cells. These data should pave the way for a clinical effectiveness study using inhaled iloprost for the treatment of asthma.
17273750	Cimetidine induces apoptosis of human salivary gland tumor cells.	It has been reported that cimetidine, a histamine type-2 receptor (H2R) antagonist, inhibits the growth of glandular tumors such as colorectal cancer. However, its effects against salivary gland tumors are still unknown. We demonstrated previously that human salivary gland tumor (HSG) cells spontaneously express the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and also that HSG cell proliferation could be controlled via a homophilic (NCAM-NCAM) binding mechanism and that NCAM may be associated with perineural invasion by malignant salivary gland tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cimetidine via the expression of NCAM on tumor growth and perineural/neural invasion in salivary gland tumor cells. Expression of both NCAM mRNA and protein was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with cimetidine for 24 h. The MTT assay and confocal laser microscopy clearly showed that HSG cells underwent apoptosis after treatment with cimetidine. Activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 was observed in HSG cells after cimetidine treatment, thus confirming that the apoptosis was induced by the activated caspases. Apaf-1 activity was also detected in HSG cells in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with cimetidine. We also found that the cimetidine-mediated down-regulation of NCAM expression in HSG cells did not occur via blocking of the histamine receptor, even though H2R expression was observed on HSG cells, as two other H2R antagonists, famotidine and ranitidine, did not show similar effects. We demonstrated for the first time that cimetidine can induce significant apoptosis of salivary gland tumor cells, which express NCAM, at least in part by down-regulation of NCAM expression on the cells. These findings suggest that the growth, development and perineural/neural invasion of salivary gland tumor cells can be blocked by cimetidine administration through down-regulation of NCAM expression, as well as induction of apoptosis.
17287200	Alix (AIP1) is a vasopressin receptor (V2R)-interacting protein that increases lysosomal degradation of the V2R.	The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a central role in renal water reabsorption. Termination of ligand (vasopressin) stimulation is an important physiological regulatory event, but few proteins that interact with the V2R during downregulation after vasopressin (VP) binding have been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid screening of a human kidney cDNA library, we show that a 100-kDa protein called ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix) interacts with the last 29 amino acids of the V2R COOH terminus. This was confirmed by pull-down assays using a GST-V2R-COOH-tail fusion protein. Alix was immunolocalized in principal cells of the kidney, which also express the V2R. The function of the Alix-V2R interaction was studied by transfecting Alix into LLC-PK(1) epithelial cells expressing V2R-green fluorescent protein (GFP). Under basal conditions, V2R-GFP localized mainly at the plasma membrane. On VP treatment, V2R-GFP was internalized into perinuclear vesicles in the nontransfected cells. In contrast, V2R-GFP fluorescence was virtually undetectable 2 h after exposure to VP in cells that coexpressed Alix. Western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody showed marked degradation of the V2R after 2 h in the presence of VP and Alix, a time point at which little or no degradation was detected in the absence of Alix. In contrast, little or no degradation of the parathyroid hormone receptor was detectable in the presence or absence of Alix and/or the PTH ligand. The VP-induced disappearance of V2R-GFP was abolished by chloroquine, a lysosomal degradation inhibitor, but not by MG132, a proteosome inhibitor. These data suggest that Alix increases the rate of lysosomal degradation of V2R and may play an important regulatory role in the VP response by modulating V2R downregulation.
17296815	Sorafenib and sunitinib in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.	Despite the optimization of chemotherapy regimens, treatment outcomes for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still considered to be disappointing. Thus, clinical research of new treatment strategies is warranted. Several targeted agents have been introduced into clinical trials in NSCLC, but to date, only a few of these new agents can offer hope of a substantial impact on the natural history of the disease. One of the main reasons for the failure of several clinical trials of targeted therapy in lung cancer is that there is multilevel cross-stimulation among the targets of the new biological agents along several pathways of signal transduction that lead to neoplastic events; blocking only one of these pathways, as most first-generation targeted agents do, allows others to act as salvage or escape mechanisms for cancer cells. Sorafenib and sunitinib are two oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF and targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and stem cell factor receptor [KIT]). Sunitinib is a multitargeted inhibitor of PDGFR, KIT, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, and VEGFR. The kinases targeted and inhibited by sorafenib and sunitinib directly and indirectly regulate tumor growth, survival, and angiogenesis, and this might be expected to result in broad antitumor efficacy. Sorafenib and sunitinib have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma; sunitinib has also been approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Their mechanism of action, preclinical data, and phase II studies suggest efficacy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.
17300755	Clinical and genetic dissection of anger expression and CREB1 polymorphisms in major depressive disorder.	Anger and irritability are prominent in a subset of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) has been associated with aggression or reward/aversion in rodents, and markers near CREB1 have been linked to MDD. Therefore, we examined the association between CREB1 polymorphisms and anger expression in MDD.
17301410	The Detection of Dopamine Gene Receptors (DRD1-DRD5) Expression on Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes by Real Time PCR.	There is interrelationship between the immune and nervous systems that is accomplished by the molecular mediators. Dopamine is one of the most important neurotransmitters. Five different dopamine receptor genes (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and DRD5) have been recognized and cloned. The expression of the dopamine receptors is well characterized in the brain but little work has been done to examine their expression in other organ tissues. In certain diseases of the immune and nervous systems, alterations in dopamine receptors gene expression in different cells have been reported. This suggests that dopamine and its receptors have important role in pathophysiology of above-mentioned diseases.In the present study, using Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, we investigated dopamine receptors genes expression in PBMC of normal individuals. The PBMC was separated from normal whole blood by Ficoll-hypaque; the total cellular RNA was then extracted and the cDNA was synthesized. This process followed by real time-PCR using primer pairs specific for five dopamine receptors mRNAs and beta-actin as internal control. The results showed the presence of all types of dopamine receptors in lymphocytes of normal individuals. The specificities of the obtained PCR products for the respective dopamine receptors fragments were confirmed by sequenced analysis capillary system. In conclusion, the present study has shown that human lymphocytes express five dopamine receptors DR1-DR5. However, the conclusive evidence on the possible function of these receptors in lymphocytes remains unknown. Because lymphocytes express all of the five neuronal dopamine receptors, it is quite reasonable to consider them as a model of dopaminergic neuron.
17308006	Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity by ACE inhibitors prevents left ventricular remodeling in a rat model of heart failure.	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent the front-line pharmacological treatment of heart failure, which is characterized by left ventricular (LV) dilatation and inappropriate hypertrophy. The mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors is still unclear, but evidence suggests that they may act by influencing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. This study sought to determine whether ACE inhibitors can directly regulate MMP activity and whether this results in positive structural and functional adaptations to the heart. To this end, MMP-2 activity in LV tissue extracted from rats with an aortocaval (AV) fistula was assessed by in vitro incubation as well as in vivo treatment with captopril, lisinopril, or quinapril. Furthermore, LV size and function were determined in untreated AV fistula rats, AV fistula rats treated with lisinopril (3, 5, and 8 wk), and age-matched sham-operated controls. In vitro incubation with captopril, lisinopril, or quinapril significantly reduced MMP-2 activity, as did in vivo treatment. This occurred without a reduction in the available pool of MMP-2 protein. Long-term in vivo administration of lisinopril also prevented LV dilatation, attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, and prevented changes in myocardial compliance and contractility. The results herein demonstrate that ACE inhibitors prevent MMP-2 activity and, in so doing, represent a mechanism responsible for preventing the negative structural and functional changes that occur in the rat AV fistula model of heart failure.
17314321	Activation of single nicotinic receptor channels from Caenorhabditis elegans muscle.	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that mediate synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system in vertebrates and invertebrates. Caenorhabditis elegans is a nonmammalian model for the study of the nervous system and a model of parasitic nematodes. Nematode muscle nAChRs are of considerable interest because they are targets for anthelmintic drugs. We show single-channel activity of C. elegans muscle nAChRs for the first time. Our results reveal that in the L1 larval stage acetylcholine (ACh) activates mainly a levamisole-sensitive nAChR (L-AChR). A single population of 39 pS channels, which are 5-fold more sensitive to levamisole than ACh, is detected. In contrast to mammalian nAChRs, open durations are longer for levamisole than for ACh. Studies in mutant strains reveal that UNC-38, UNC-63, and UNC-29 subunits are assembled into a single L-AChR in the L1 stage and that these subunits are irreplaceable, suggesting that they are vital for receptor function throughout development. Recordings from a strain mutated in the LEV-1 subunit show a main population of channels with lower conductance (26 pS), prolonged open durations, and reduced sensitivity to levamisole. Thus, although LEV-1 is preferentially incorporated into native L-AChRs, receptors lacking this subunit can still function. No single-channel activity from levamisole-insensitive nAChRs is detected. Thus, during neuromuscular transmission in C. elegans, the majority of ACh-activated current flows through L-AChRs. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying functional diversity of the nAChR family and offers an excellent strategy to test novel antiparasitic drugs.
17322116	Resistance exercise and cyclooxygenase (COX) expression in human skeletal muscle: implications for COX-inhibiting drugs and protein synthesis.	We have shown that ibuprofen and acetaminophen block cyclooxygenase (COX) synthesis of prostaglandin PGF(2alpha) and the muscle protein synthesis increase following resistance exercise. Confusingly, these two drugs are purported to work through different mechanisms, with acetaminophen apparently unable to block COX and ibuprofen able to nonspecifically block COX-1 and COX-2. A recently discovered intron-retaining COX, now known to have three variants, has been shown to be sensitive to both drugs. We measured the expression patterns and levels of the intron 1-retaining COX-1 variants (-1b1, -1b2, and -1b3), COX-1, and COX-2 at rest and following resistance exercise to help elucidate the COX through which PGF(2alpha), ibuprofen, and acetaminophen regulate muscle protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle biopsy samples were taken from 16 individuals (8M, 8F) before, 4, and 24 h after a bout of resistance exercise and analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. Relatively few individuals expressed the intron 1-retaining COX-1b variants (COX-1b1, -1b2, and -1b3) at any time point, and when expressed, these variants were in very low abundance. COX-1 was the most abundant COX mRNA before exercise and remained unchanged (P > 0.05) following exercise. COX-2 was not expressed before exercise, but increased significantly (P < 0.05) at 4 and 24 h after exercise. The inconsistent and low levels of expression of the intron 1-retaining COX-1 variants suggest that these variants are not likely responsible for the inhibition of PGF(2alpha) production and skeletal muscle protein synthesis after resistance exercise by ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Skeletal muscle-specific inhibition of COX-1 or COX-2 by these drugs should be considered.
17322500	Is the effect of testosterone on body composition modulated by the androgen receptor gene CAG repeat polymorphism in elderly men?	The androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a CAG repeat polymorphism coding for a polyglutamine chain, the length of which is inversely correlated with AR transcriptional activity. We explored whether this polymorphism modulates the activities of testosterone (T) related to body composition in elderly men.
1732532	Structure-antigastrin activity relationships of new (R)-4-benzamido-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives.	New (R)-4-benzamido-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives were synthesized by a stereoconservative procedure and evaluated in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the binding of [125I](BH)-CCK-8 to either rat peripheral (CCK-A) or central (CCK-B) CCK receptors, or the binding of [3H]pentagastrin to rabbit gastric glands, as well as to inhibit, in vivo, the acid secretion induced by pentagastrin infusion in the perfused rat stomach. The parent compound of this series (lorglumide) is the first nonpeptidic, potent and selective antagonist of the CCK-A receptor. Chemical manipulations of the structure of lorglumide led to the discovery of selective antagonists of the CCK-B/gastrin receptors. Structure-activity relationships are discussed. Some of these new derivatives exhibit different affinities with rabbit gastric gland cells and rat cortex membranes, suggesting that the stomach gastrin receptor (arbitrarily termed CCK-B1 receptor) is not as closely related to the CCK central receptor (termed CCK-B2) as previously hypothesized. The antigastric activity of the most potent compound of the series, i.e. (R)-4-(3,5-dichlorobenzamido)-5-(8-azaspiro[4.5]decan- 8-yl)-5-oxopentanoic acid (compound 28, CR 2194) was further evaluated in vivo: in the first hour after administration the compound inhibits acid secretion induced by pentagastrin infusion, in both cat and dog (in the cat with gastric fistula and in the dog with Heidenhain pouch), with ID50s (mg/kg) of 15.5 (iv) (cat), 8.7 (IV) (dog) and 24.2 (oral) (Heidenhain dog). The characteristics of CR 2194, that is, the selectivity for the gastrin receptor, the simple nonpeptidic molecular structure, and the activity after oral administration, indicate that this compound is a useful tool in the study of the biological effects of gastrin and a potential agent for diagnostic or therapeutic use.
17336114	A prevalent pathogenic GAMT mutation (c.59G>C) in Portugal.	Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (MIM 601240), an autosomal recessive disorder of creatine biosynthesis, presents with mental retardation, extrapyramidal symptoms, autistic-like behavior and epilepsy. Other hallmarks are cerebral creatine deficiency, increased levels of guanidinoacetate in body fluids and mutations in the GAMT gene. Creatine supplementation partially restores cerebral creatine content. Worldwide, 29 patients have been identified and 15 different mutations have been reported in the GAMT gene. Ten out of these 29 patients are of Portuguese origin. Likely, a founder effect and a high carrier rate in Portugal exist, since in 17 out of the 20 Portuguese alleles the c.59G>C; p.Trp20Ser mutation was found. We investigated the carrier rate of the c.59G>C; p.Trp20Ser mutation in different regions of Portugal and confirmed the pathogenic nature of this missense mutation by transient transfections. Anonymous bloodspots (1002) were screened for the presence of the c.59G>C; p.Trp20Ser mutation by SNaPshot (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Multiplex Kit). Eight carriers of c.59G>C; p.Trp20Ser were detected of which four are derived from the Archipelagos. This suggests that the carrier rate of the c.59G>C; p.Trp20Ser mutation is relatively high in these islands, as well as in other parts of Portugal. It also implies that newborn screening in these regions is warranted for this treatable disorder.
17337452	Engineered monomeric human histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 hydrolyzes fluorogenic acyl-adenylate and lysyl-tRNA synthetase-generated lysyl-adenylate.	Hint1 is a homodimeric protein and member of the ubiquitous HIT superfamily. Hint1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of purine phosphoramidates and lysyl-adenylate generated by lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS). To determine the importance of homodimerization on the biological and catalytic activity of Hint1, the dimer interface of human Hint1 (hHint1) was destabilized by replacement of Val(97) of hHint1 with Asp, Glu, or Arg. The mutants were shown to exist as monomers in solution by a combination of size exclusion chromatograph, static light scattering, and chemically induced dimerization studies. Circular dichroism studies revealed little difference between the stability of the V97D, V97E, and wild-type hHint1. Relative to wild-type and the V97E mutant, however, significant perturbation of the V97D mutant structure was observed. hHint1 was shown to prefer 3-indolepropionic acyl-adenylate (AIPA) over tryptamine adenosine phosphoramidate monoester (TpAd). Wild-type hHint1 was found to be 277- and 1000-fold more efficient (k(cat)/K(m) values) than the V97E and V97D mutants, respectively. Adenylation of wild-type, V97D, and V97E hHint1 by human LysRS was shown to correlate with the mutant k(cat)/K(m) values using 3-indolepropionic acyl-adenylate as a substrate, but not tryptamine adenosine phosphoramidate monoester. Significant perturbations of the active site residues were not detected by molecular dynamics simulations of the hHint1s. Taken together, these results demonstrate that for hHint1; 1) the efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of acylated AMP hydrolysis, but not maximal catalytic turnover (k(cat)), is dependent on homodimerization and 2) the hydrolysis of lysyl-AMP generated by LysRS is not dependent on homodimerization if the monomer structure is similar to the wild-type structure.
17346280	Histamine H4 receptor agonists have more activities than H4 agonism in antigen-specific human T-cell responses.	Histamine not only mediates immediate allergic reactions, it also regulates cellular immune responses. H4R is the most recently identified histamine receptor (HR). In the present study, we examined the in vitro effect of histamine and H4R agonists on the responses of human T cells to purified protein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD) and to Cry j1, the major allergen of Cryptomeria japonica pollen. Dimaprit, clobenpropit and clozapine, which are H4R agonists, dose-dependently blocked both PPD-induced interferon-gamma and Cry j1-induced interleukin-5 production by both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and antigen-specific T-cell lines. However, the addition of thioperamide, an H3R/H4R antagonist, as well as a mixture of d-chlropheniramine, famotidine and thioperamide, did not reverse the inhibition. Pretreatment of PBMCs with SQ22536 and 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer, had varying abilities to reverse the inhibitory effects of H4R agonists, except for clobenpropit. Moreover, the addition of H4R agonists induced annexin-V expression on PBMCs, especially in CD19(+) and CD4(+) cells. cDNA microarray analysis revealed that, among 16,600 genes tested, increased expression following treatment with clozapine was seen in 0 x 8% of the genes, whereas decreased expression was seen in 3 x 0% of the genes. These results suggest that H4R agonists inhibit antigen-specific human T-cell responses, although H4R does not appear to be important for this effect. In addition, the present study indicated that there may be orphan receptors or HR subtypes which can bind dimaprit, clobenpropit and clozapine, and that can exert an inhibitory effect on antigen-specific cellular responses via a cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent, apoptotic pathway.
17350930	AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetases in Archaea show unexpected diversity in substrate utilization.	Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS; acetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6.2.1.1) is a key enzyme for conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, an essential intermediate at the junction of anabolic and catabolic pathways. Phylogenetic analysis of putative short and medium chain acyl-CoA synthetase sequences indicates that the ACSs form a distinct clade from other acyl-CoA synthetases. Within this clade, the archaeal ACSs are not monophyletic and fall into three groups composed of both bacterial and archaeal sequences. Kinetic analysis of two archaeal enzymes, an ACS from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (designated as MT-ACS1) and an ACS from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (designated as AF-ACS2), revealed that these enzymes have very different properties. MT-ACS1 has nearly 11-fold higher affinity and 14-fold higher catalytic efficiency with acetate than with propionate, a property shared by most ACSs. However, AF-ACS2 has only 2.3-fold higher affinity and catalytic efficiency with acetate than with propionate. This enzyme has an affinity for propionate that is almost identical to that of MT-ACS1 for acetate and nearly tenfold higher than the affinity of MT-ACS1 for propionate. Furthermore, MT-ACS1 is limited to acetate and propionate as acyl substrates, whereas AF-ACS2 can also utilize longer straight and branched chain acyl substrates. Phylogenetic analysis, sequence alignment and structural modeling suggest a molecular basis for the altered substrate preference and expanded substrate range of AF-ACS2 versus MT-ACS1.
17355124	Structure-function analysis of glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase (ATase, EC 2.7.7.49) of Escherichia coli.	Glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase (ATase) regulates the activity of glutamine synthetase by adenylylation and deadenylylation in response to signals of nitrogen and carbon status: glutamine, alpha-ketoglutarate, and the uridylylated and unmodified forms of the PII signal transduction protein. ATase consists of two conserved nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domains linked by a central region of approximately 200 amino acids. Here, we study the activities and regulation of mutated and truncated forms of ATase. Our results indicate the following. (i) The N-terminal NT domain contained the adenylyl-removing (AR) active site, and the C-terminal NT domain contained the adenylyltransferase (AT) active site. (ii) The enzyme contained a glutamine binding site, and glutamine increased the affinity for PII. (iii) The enzyme appeared to contain multiple sites for the binding of PII and PII-UMP. (iv) Truncated versions of ATase missing the C-terminal (NT) domain lacked both AT and AR activity, suggesting a role for the C-terminal NT domain in both activities. (v) The purified C-terminal NT domain and larger polypeptides containing this domain had significant basal AT activity, which was stimulated by glutamine. These polypeptides were indifferent to PII and PII-UMP, or their ATase activity was inhibited by either PII or PII-UMP. (vi) Certain point mutations in the central region or an internal deletion removing most of this part of the protein eliminated the AR activity and eliminated activation of the AT activity by PII, while not eliminating the binding of PII or PII-UMP. That is, these mutations in the central region appeared to destroy the communication between the PII and PII-UMP binding sites and the AT and AR active sites. (vii) Certain mutations in the central region of ATase appeared to dramatically improve the binding of glutamine to the enzyme. (viii) While the isolated AT and AR domains of ATase bound poorly to PII and PII-UMP, these domains bound PII and PII-UMP significantly better when linked to the central region of ATase. Together, our results indicate a highly coordinated enzyme, in which the AT and AR domains participate in each other's regulation and distant regulatory sites are in communication with each other. A model for the regulation of ATase by glutamine, PII, and PII-UMP consistent with all data is presented.
17355125	Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase (ATase, EC 2.7.7.49): kinetic characterization of regulation by PII, PII-UMP, glutamine, and alpha-ketoglutarate.	Glutamine synthetase adenylyltranferase (ATase, EC 2.7.7.49) catalyzes the adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase (GS), regulating GS activity. The adenylyltransferase (AT) reaction is activated by glutamine and by the unmodified form of the PII signal transduction protein and is inhibited by the uridylylated form of PII, PII-UMP. Conversely, the adenylyl-removing (AR) reaction is activated by PII-UMP and is inhibited by glutamine and by PII. Both AT and AR reactions are regulated by alpha-ketoglutarate, which binds to PII and PII-UMP. Here, we present a kinetic analysis of the AT and AR activities and their regulation. Both AT and AR reactions used a sequential mechanism of rapid equilibrium random binding of substrates and products. Activators and inhibitors had little effect on the binding of substrates, instead exerting their effects on catalysis. Our results were consistent with PII, PII-UMP, and glutamine shifting the enzyme among at least six different enzyme forms, two of which were inactive, one of which exhibited AR activity, and three of which exhibited AT activity. In addition to a site for glutamine, the enzyme appeared to contain two distinct sites for PII and PII-UMP. The PII, PII-UMP, and glutamine sites were in communication so that the apparent activation and inhibition constants for regulators depended upon each other. The binding of PII was favored by glutamine and its level reduced by PII-UMP, whereas glutamine and PII-UMP competed for the enzyme. alpha-Ketoglutarate, which acts exclusively through its binding to PII and PII-UMP, did not alter the binding of PII or PII-UMP to the enzyme. Rather, alpha-ketoglutarate dramatically affected the extent of activation or inhibition of the enzyme by PII or PII-UMP. A working hypothesis for the regulation of the AT and AR activities, consistent with all data, is presented.
17356573	Chronic blockade or constitutive deletion of the serotonin transporter reduces operant responding for food reward.	The therapeutic effects of chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are well documented, yet the elementary behavioral processes that are affected by such treatment have not been fully investigated. We report here the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment and genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter (SERT) on food reinforced behavior in three paradigms: the progressive ratio operant task, the concurrent choice operant task, and the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer task. We consistently find that chronic pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of SERT result in similar behavioral consequences: reduced operant responding for natural reward. This is in line with previous studies reporting declines in operant responding for drugs and intracranial self-stimulation with fluoxetine treatment, suggesting that the effect of SERT blockade can be generalized to different reward types. Detailed analyses of behavioral parameters indicate that this reduction in operant responding affect both goal-directed and non-goal-directed behaviors without affecting the Pavlovian cue-triggered excessive operant responding. In addition, both pharmacological and genetic manipulations reduce locomotor activity in the open field novel environment. Our data contrast with the effect of dopamine in increasing operant responding for natural reward specifically in goal-directed behaviors and in increasing Pavlovian cue-triggered excessive operant responding. Serotonin and dopamine have been proposed to serve opposing functions in motivational processes. Our data suggest that their interactions do not result in simple opponency. The fact that pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of SERT have similar behavioral consequences reinforces the utility of the SERT null mice for investigation of the mechanisms underlying chronic SSRIs treatment.
17360906	NMDA receptor subunits have differential roles in mediating excitotoxic neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo.	Well-documented experimental evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models of stroke strongly supports the critical involvement of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in neuronal damage after stroke. Despite this, the results of clinical trials testing NMDA receptor antagonists as neuroprotectants after stroke and brain trauma have been discouraging. Here, we report that in mature cortical cultures, activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors results in excitotoxicity, increasing neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NR2A-containing NMDA receptors promotes neuronal survival and exerts a neuroprotective action against both NMDA receptor-mediated and non-NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal damage. A similar opposing action of NR2B and NR2A in mediating cell death and cell survival was also observed in an in vivo rat model of focal ischemic stroke. Moreover, we found that blocking NR2B-mediated cell death was effective in reducing infarct volume only when the receptor antagonist was given before the onset of stroke and not 4.5 h after stroke. In great contrast, activation of NR2A-mediated cell survival signaling with administration of either glycine alone or in the presence of NR2B antagonist significantly attenuated ischemic brain damage even when delivered 4.5 h after stroke onset. Together, the present work provides a molecular basis for the dual roles of NMDA receptors in promoting neuronal survival and mediating neuronal damage and suggests that selective enhancement of NR2A-containing NMDA receptor activation with glycine may constitute a promising therapy for stroke.
17364237	Malathion, carbofuran and paraquat inhibit Bungarus sindanus (krait) venom acetylcholinesterase and human serum butyrylcholinesterase in vitro.	Carbofuran and malathion, well known pesticides, and paraquat, a world widely used herbicide, were tested on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Bungarus sindanus venom and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) from human serum. The calculated IC(50 )values for inhibition of venom enzyme by malathion, carbofuran and paraquat were 2.5, 0.14, and 0.16 microM, respectively. The values for inhibition of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were 3.5, 0.09 and 0.18 microM, respectively. Analysis of kinetic data indicated that the inhibition caused by malathion, carbofuran and paraquat was mixed for venom AChE. For BChE from human serum, the inhibition caused by malathion and paraquat was mixed and for carbofuran it was uncompetitive. The present results suggest a commercial paraquat preparation (a popular herbicide) inhibits cholinesterases with similar or higher potency than classical pesticide inhibitors. Furthermore, this inhibition was observed both in human serum and snake venom, a newly studied source of AChE.
17367763	Sunitinib: a VEGF and PDGF receptor protein kinase and angiogenesis inhibitor.	Sunitinib (SU-11248, Sutent) inhibits at least eight receptor protein-tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 (VEGFR1-VEGFR3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta), stem cell factor receptor (Kit), Flt-3, and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 play key roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. PDGFRbeta, which is found in pericytes that surround capillary endothelial cells, plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the vascular endothelium. Sunitinib inhibits angiogenesis by diminishing signaling through VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and PDGFRbeta. Renal cell cancers that have metastasized, or spread from the primary tumor, exhibit extensive vascularity, and sunitinib is approved for the treatment of these neoplasms. Activating Kit mutations occur in about 85% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and activating PDGFRalpha mutations occur in about 5% of these tumors. Sunitinib is approved for the treatment of those tumors that are resistant to imatinib (STI-571, Gleevec), another Kit and PDGFRalpha protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Both sunitinib and imatinib bind reversibly to the ATP binding site of their target kinases and thereby inhibit their catalytic activity.
17379648	The ultraviolet filter benzophenone 2 interferes with the thyroid hormone axis in rats and is a potent in vitro inhibitor of human recombinant thyroid peroxidase.	Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), either plant constituents or contaminants deriving from industrial products, may interfere with the thyroid hormone (TH) axis. Here, we examined whether selected EDCs inhibit the key reactions of TH biosynthesis catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (TPO). We used a novel in vitro assay based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into the human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-238. F21388 (synthetic flavonoid), bisphenol A (building block for polycarbonates), and the UV filter benzophenone 2 (BP2) inhibited hrTPO. BP2 is contained in numerous cosmetics of daily use and may be in regular contact with human skin. Half-maximal inhibition in the guaiacol assay occurred at 450 nmol/liter BP2, a concentration 20- and 200-fold lower than those required in case of the TPO-inhibiting antithyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil, respectively. BP2 at 300 nmol/liter combined with the TPO substrate H(2)O(2) (10 mumol/liter) inactivated hrTPO; this was, however, prevented by micromolar amounts of iodide. BP2 did not inhibit iodide uptake into FRTL-5 cells. In BP2-treated rats (333 and 1000 mg/kg body weight), serum total T(4) was significantly decreased and serum thyrotropin was significantly increased. TPO activities in the thyroids of treated animals were unchanged, a finding also described for methimazole and propylthiouracil. Thus, EDCs, most potently BP2, may disturb TH homeostasis by inhibiting or inactivating TPO, effects that are even more pronounced in the absence of iodide. This new challenge for endocrine regulation must be considered in the context of a still prevailing iodide deficiency in many parts of the world.
17385063	Hypotensive effect of hydroxylamine, an endogenous nitric oxide donor and SSAO inhibitor.	The endogenous compound hydroxylamine relaxes vascular smooth muscle in vitro, apparently through conversion to the vasodilator factor nitric oxide, but its effect on blood pressure has not been characterized. We found that in the anesthetized rat the amine elicits dose-related hypotension when administered by continuous iv infusion. In experiments designed to explore the mechanism of this effect, hydroxylamine was compared with the nitric oxide donor nitroprusside and the direct-acting vasodilator hydralazine, using pretreatments known to modify diverse mechanisms of vasodilation. Hydroxylamine hypotension was enhanced by the SSAO inhibitor isoniazid and the SSAO substrate methylamine, a pattern shared by hydralazine. Responses were blocked by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue and were increased by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, a pattern shared by nitroprusside. It was concluded that hydroxylamine exerts hypotension partly through conversion to nitric oxide and partly by a "hydralazine-like" mechanism involving SSAO inhibition.
17389618	Twenty-four non-synonymous polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic pathway and risk of colorectal adenoma in the Nurses' Health Study.	Dietary folate and alcohol consumption as well as polymorphic variants in one-carbon metabolism genes may modulate risk of colorectal adenoma through aberrant DNA methylation and altered nucleotide synthesis and repair. We assessed the association of 24 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in 13 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and risk of colorectal adenoma in 556 incident cases and 557 controls nested in the Nurses' Health Study. Most of the SNPs were not associated with risk of colorectal adenoma. We did, however, observe a modest increased risk among carriers of the transcobalamin (TCN) II 259 Pro/Arg + Arg/Arg variant (odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.02) for colorectal adenoma. The TCN II Pro259Arg polymorphism may affect TCN binding and transport of vitamin B(12) and thus warrants further investigation of its biological function. In addition, the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) Arg415Cys and MTRR Ser284Thr variant carriers, also in the vitamin B(12) pathway, have suggestive associations with advanced colorectal adenoma (defined as being larger than 1 cm, villous, tubular-villous or carcinoma in situ histology). We observed significant evidence for departure from multiplicative interaction for the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) Arg239Gln with dietary methyl status (based on intake of dietary folate, methionine and alcohol intake) in relation to colorectal adenoma; no such interaction was observed for the other 23 SNPs. Further investigation is required to validate the association of the polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic genes and risk of colorectal adenoma.
17394052	Dopamine genes and pathological gambling in discordant sib-pairs.	Pathological gambling (PG) is an impulse control disorder that has been considered as a behavioral addiction. Recent studies have suggested the involvement of the dopaminergic system in addictions and impulse control disorders and associations of dopamine receptor genes (DRD1, DRD2, and DRD4) and PG have been reported. In the present study, 140 sib-pairs discordant for the diagnosis of PG (70 males and 70 females on each group) were recruited through the Gambling Outpatient Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo and were assessed by trained psychiatrists. A family-based association design was chosen to prevent population stratification. All subjects were genotyped for dopamine receptor genes (DRD1 -800 T/C, DRD2 TaqIA RFLP, DRD3 Ser9Gly, DRD4 48bp exon III VNTR, DRD5 (CA) repeat) and the dopamine transporter gene (SCL6A3 40 bp VNTR). Our results suggest the association of PG with DRD1 -800 T/C allele T (P = .03).
17403057	Changes in circulating lymphocyte subpopulations following administration of the leucocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3)/IgG1 fusion protein alefacept.	Alefacept, a recombinant leucocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3)/IgG1 fusion protein approved for the treatment of psoriasis, is reported to reduce selectively the numbers of circulating CD4(+) CD45RO(+) and CD8(+) CD45RO(+) T cells, while sparing the naive cells. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate further the effect of alefacept on various circulating lymphocyte subsets. Sixteen patients, 12 with chronic plaque psoriasis and four with pustular psoriasis, received alefacept 7.5 mg once weekly for 12 weeks. Blood samples collected at study entry and after 12 weeks of treatment were analysed by four-colour flow cytometry. There were statistically significant reductions in the total number of conventional memory (CD45RA(-) CD27(+)) and effector (CD45RA(-) CD27(-) or CD45RA(+) CD27(-)) T cells, including CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing CD161 and CD8(+) T cells expressing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA). Natural killer (NK) T cells were also reduced significantly, while no statistically significant changes were seen in NK cells and CD4(+) CD25(high) cells. The affected subpopulations were all characterized by a high expression of CD2. However, CD4(+) CD25(low), and CD4(+) CLA(+) cells, which also expressed relative high levels of CD2, were not reduced significantly. Our results suggest a heterogeneous effect of alefacept on the circulating memory T cell population, indicating that high expression of CD2 may not, by itself, be sufficient to explain the reduction in cell count for a specific subpopulation.
17405869	Decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor-NR2B subunit levels by intrathecal short-hairpin RNA blocks group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated hyperalgesia.	The present study characterizes the involvement of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in mediating thermal hyperalgesia induced by activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Intrathecal administration of the mGluR1/5 agonist (S)-3,5-DHPG [(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] to mice resulted in significant hyperalgesia as assessed by the tail immersion test. The pretreatment of mice i.t. with CGS 19755 (selective antagonist of the NMDAR), CGP 78608 [[(1S)-1-[[(7-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,3-dioxo-5-quinoxalinyl)methyl]amino]ethyl]phosphonic acid] (selective antagonist at the glycine-binding site of the NMDAR), ifenprodil and Ro 25-6981 (selective antagonists of the NR2B subunit of the NMDAR), bisindolylmaleimide I and Go-7874 [12-(2-cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo(2,3-a)pyrrolo(3,4-c)-carbazole] (inhibitors of protein kinase C), or PKI-(14-22)-amide [Myr-N-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-NH(2)] (inhibitor of protein kinase A) dose-dependently inhibited the hyperalgesia induced by i.t. administration of the mGluR1/5 receptor agonist (S)-3,5-DHPG. In contrast, i.t. pretreatment of mice with NVP-AAM077 [[(R)-[(S)-1-(4-bromophenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid] (selective antagonist of the NR2A subunit of the NMDAR) or DT-3 [H-Arg-Gln-Ile-Lys-Ile-Trp-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Arg-Met-Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys-Leu-Arg-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-His-OH] (inhibitor of protein kinase G) had no effect on (S)-3,5-DHPG-mediated hyperalgesia. We also show for the first time that i.t. injection of pSM2 (pShag Magic version 2)-grin2b (coding for an short-hairpin RNA to the NR2B subunit of the NMDAR) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the NR2B protein and blockade of hyperalgesia induced by activation of the mGluR1/5 in (S)-3,5-DHPG-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest the hypothesis that mGluRs are coupled to the NMDAR channels through the NR2B subunit in the spinal cord and that this coupling involves the activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase A.
17408613	Hypophagic effect of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan in rats.	Recent experimental and clinical studies report beneficial metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs interfering with angiotensin. Antagonists at the angiotensin AT(1) receptor can reduce blood glucose and triglyceride levels. So far, there is little evidence, however, that angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists can also affect food intake. Particularly unknown is if drugs of this class can have acute effects on short term feeding. To address this issue, the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan was studied in a one-hour feeding paradigm in rats. In this study, irbesartan was investigated in comparison with fenfluramine, an established satiating drug, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. We found a significant reduction of one-hour food intake following 100-200 mg/kg (i.p.) irbesartan. The ACE inhibitor captopril (25-100 mg/kg i.p.) remained without effect on food intake and fenfluramine showed the expected hypophagic action starting at 1 mg/kg (i.p.). The hypophagic effect of irbesartan could not be attributed to sedation or any gross effect on motor activity as determined both upon feeding and independent activity experiments. Fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) and irbesartan (100 mg/kg) did not reduce the latency to feed, but similarly reduced the eating rate at the beginning of the test meal. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a hypophagic effect of the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan that cannot be attributed to sedation or antidipsic effects of the drug.
17408927	Genetic and proteomic characterization of rifaximin resistance in Bifidobacterium infantis BI07.	Rifaximin resistance in the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium infantis BI07 was studied to assess the use of an antibiotic-probiotic combination for clinical management of intestinal disorders. A rifaximin-resistant mutant was selected and a 129 bp core region of the rpoB gene was sequenced and compared with the respective sequence of the sensitive clone. A miss-sense mutation of codon 513, producing the substitution of Gln with Arg in the protein sequence, was found. The involvement of metabolic changes associated with rifaximin resistance was also investigated by proteomic analysis performed with two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The principal categories of proteins, whose expression levels varied as a consequence of rifaximin resistance, included chaperonins, regulatory factors and metabolic enzymes. The hypothesis of rifaximin inactivation by bacterial enzymatic activities was excluded, as neither structural modifications nor degradation derivates of the drug moiety was identified using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
17417877	Reduction of high-affinity beta2-adrenergic receptor binding by hyperforin and hyperoside on rat C6 glioblastoma cells measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.	Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are potential targets for antidepressants. Desensitization and downregulation of beta-AR are discussed as possible modes of action for antidepressants. We have investigated the effects of hyperforin and hyperoside, compounds with potentially antidepressant activity from St. John's Wort, on the binding behavior and dynamics of beta2-AR in living rat C6 glioblastoma cells, compared to desipramine (desmethylimipramine; DMI) by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence microscopy. FCS-binding studies with the fluorescently labeled ligand Alexa532-noradrenaline (Alexa532-NA) binding to beta2-AR of C6 cells showed a significant reduction in total beta2-AR binding after preincubation with hyperforin and hyperoside for 3 days, respectively, which was also found for DMI. This was mainly observed in high-affinity receptor-ligand complexes with hindered lateral mobility (D2 = 1.1 (+/-0.4) microm2/s) in the biomembrane. However, internalization of beta2-AR was found neither in z-scans of these C6 cells nor in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with GFP-tagged beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR-GFP) after incubation up to 6 days with either DMI, hyperforin, or hyperoside. Thus, under these conditions reduction of beta2-AR binding was not mediated by receptor internalization. Additionally, preincubation of C6 cells with DMI, hyperforin, and hyperoside led to a loss of second messenger cAMP after beta2-adrenergic stimulating conditions with terbutaline. Our current results indicate that hyperforin and hyperoside from St. John's Wort, as well as DMI, reduce beta2-adrenergic sensitivity in C6 cells, emphasizing the potential usefulness of St. John's Wort dry extracts in clinical treatment of depressive symptoms.
17428498	Crystal structure of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase complexed with adenosine-5' tetraphosphate: evidence for distributed use of catalytic binding energy in amino acid activation by class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.	Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is a functionally dimeric ligase, which specifically couples hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate to the formation of an ester bond between tryptophan and the cognate tRNA. TrpRS from Bacillus stearothermophilus binds the ATP analogue, adenosine-5' tetraphosphate (AQP) competitively with ATP during pyrophosphate exchange. Estimates of binding affinity from this competitive inhibition and from isothermal titration calorimetry show that AQP binds 200 times more tightly than ATP both under conditions of induced-fit, where binding is coupled to an unfavorable conformational change, and under exchange conditions, where there is no conformational change. These binding data provide an indirect experimental measurement of +3.0 kcal/mol for the conformational free energy change associated with induced-fit assembly of the active site. Thermodynamic parameters derived from the calorimetry reveal very modest enthalpic changes, consistent with binding driven largely by a favorable entropy change. The 2.5 A structure of the TrpRS:AQP complex, determined de novo by X-ray crystallography, resembles that of the previously described, pre-transition state TrpRS:ATP complexes. The anticodon-binding domain untwists relative to the Rossmann-fold domain by 20% of the way toward the orientation observed for the Products complex. An unexpected tetraphosphate conformation allows the gamma and deltad phosphate groups to occupy positions equivalent to those occupied by the beta and gamma phosphates of ATP. The beta-phosphate effects a 1.11 A extension that relocates the alpha-phosphate toward the tryptophan carboxylate while the PPi mimic moves deeper into the KMSKS loop. This configuration improves interactions between enzyme and nucleotide significantly and uniformly in the adenosine and PPi binding subsites. A new hydrogen bond forms between S194 from the class I KMSKS signature sequence and the PPi mimic. These complementary thermodynamic and structural data are all consistent with the conclusion that the tetraphosphate mimics a transition-state in which the KMSKS loop develops increasingly tight bonds to the PPi leaving group, weakening linkage to the Palpha as it is relocated by an energetically favorable domain movement. Consistent with extensive mutational data on Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, this aspect of the mechanism develops high transition-state affinity for the adenosine and pyrophosphate moieties, which move significantly, relative to one another, during the catalytic step.
17430993	A Nav1.7 channel mutation associated with hereditary erythromelalgia contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability and displays reduced lidocaine sensitivity.	Mutations in the TTX-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel subtype Nav1.7 have been implicated in the painful inherited neuropathy, hereditary erythromelalgia. Hereditary erythromelalgia can be difficult to treat and, although sodium channels are targeted by local anaesthetics such as lidocaine (lignocaine), some patients do not respond to treatment with local anaesthetics. This study examined electrophysiological differences in Nav1.7 caused by a hereditary erythromelalgia mutation (N395K) that lies within the local anaesthetic binding site of the channel. The N395K mutation produced a hyperpolarized voltage dependence of activation, slower kinetics of deactivation, and impaired steady-state slow inactivation. Computer simulations indicate that the shift in activation is the major determinant of the hyperexcitability induced by erythromelalgia mutations in sensory neurons, but that changes in slow inactivation can modulate the overall impact on excitability. This study also investigated lidocaine inhibition of the Nav1.7-N395K channel. We show that the N395K mutation attenuates the inhibitory effects of lidocaine on both resting and inactivated Nav1.7. The IC50 for lidocaine was estimated at 500 microM for inactivated wild-type Nav1.7 and 2.8 mM for inactivated Nav1.7-N395K. The N395K mutation also significantly reduced use-dependent inhibition of lidocaine on Nav1.7 current. In contrast, a different hereditary erythromelalgia mutation (F216S), not located in the local anaesthetic binding site, had no effect on lidocaine inhibition of Nav1.7 current. Our observation of reduced lidocaine inhibition on Nav1.7-N395K shows that the residue N395 is critical for lidocaine binding to Nav1.7 and suggests that the response of individuals with hereditary erythromelalgia to lidocaine treatment may be determined, at least in part, by their specific genotype.
17431118	Dasatinib (BMS-354825) inhibits Stat5 signaling associated with apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.	Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a novel, oral, potent, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases (SFK) and is a promising cancer therapeutic agent. Preclinical data indicate that dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl, and that dasatinib is active against 18 of 19 Bcr-Abl mutations known to cause imatinib resistance. Phase I clinical data show that dasatinib is well tolerated and highly effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism of action of dasatinib is not fully understood. In this study, we confirm that dasatinib inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of SFKs, including Src, Hck, and Lyn, in K562 human CML cells. Significantly, downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) signaling is also blocked by dasatinib as shown by decreases in levels of phosphorylated Stat5 and Stat5 DNA-binding activities. In addition, dasatinib down-regulates expression of Stat5 target genes, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and cyclin D1. Consistent with these results, blockade of Stat5 signaling by dasatinib is accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, Stat5 DNA-binding activities are enhanced with increasing cell density, which is associated with resistance to apoptosis by dasatinib. Our findings indicate that inhibition of Stat5 signaling downstream of Bcr-Abl/SFKs contributes to the action of dasatinib, and, conversely, that increasing cell density up-regulates Stat5 activation and confers resistance to dasatinib. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated Stat5 in CML cells represents a mechanistically relevant biomarker for monitoring inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling by dasatinib in CML patients using convenient immunocytochemical assays.
17431542	Retrospective analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam in patients with metastatic brain tumors.	Seizures are a common complication of metastatic brain tumors (MBT), affecting approximately 27-50% of all patients during the course of their illness. Treatment of tumor-induced seizures is often inadequate with traditional antiepileptic drugs (AED) due to a variety of factors, including activation of glutamatergic NMDA receptors, alterations of neuronal input pathways, and tumor growth. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a 2nd generation non-enzyme inducing AED with a novel mechanism of action, binding to neuronal synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, that has been previously shown to reduce seizure activity in patients with primary brain tumors. Due to its unique mechanism of action, it has been postulated that LEV may also be effective in controlling seizures from MBT. A retrospective chart review was performed of all Neuro-Oncology Center patients with MBT who had received LEV for seizure control. Thirteen patients were reviewed with a median age of 55.1 years (range: 34-70). Six patients had breast cancer, five had lung cancer, and two had melanoma. LEV was used as an add-on AED in seven patients (54%) and as monotherapy in six patients (46%), with a median dose of 1,000 mg/day (range: 500-3,000). The baseline median seizure frequency was one ictal event every other day. After the addition of LEV, the median seizure frequency was reduced to 0 per week. The seizure frequency was reduced to less than 50% of the pre-LEV baseline in 100% of patients (P=0.0002, Sign test), with 10 patients (77%; confidence interval: 46-95%) noting complete seizure control. The most common adverse event was somnolence and headache, noted in 3 of 13 patients (23%). LEV was very effective and well tolerated in MBT patients with seizures and should be considered for add-on therapy or as a substitute AED for monotherapy.
17436372	Transgenic Panax ginseng inhibits the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 as well as COX-2 expression in human mast cells.	The most well-known medicinal plant, Panax ginseng (P. ginseng), contains various phytosterols and bioactive triterpene saponins (ginsenosides). Squalene synthase is a key regulatory enzyme for triterpene biosynthesis and overexpression of the squalene synthase confers the hyper-production of triterpene saponins to form transgenic ginseng. In this study, we have investigated whether and how transgenic P. ginseng modulates an inflammatory reaction in a stimulated human mast cell line, HMC-1. It was found that transgenic P. ginseng inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI)-stimulated HMC-1. Additionally, we have shown that transgenic P. ginseng suppressed the intracellular calcium level induced by PMACI. These results provide new insights into the pharmacological actions of transgenic P. ginseng as a potential molecule for use in therapy in mast cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.
17442842	Rifaximin is a gut-specific human pregnane X receptor activator.	Rifaximin, a rifamycin analog approved for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea, is also beneficial in the treatment of multiple chronic gastrointestinal disorders. However, the mechanisms contributing to the effects of rifaximin on chronic gastrointestinal disorders are not fully understood. In the current study, rifaximin was investigated for its role in activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in xenobiotic and limited endobiotic deposition and detoxication. PXR-humanized (hPXR), Pxr-null, and wild-type mice were treated orally with rifaximin, and rifampicin, a well characterized human PXR ligand. Rifaximin was highly concentrated in the intestinal tract compared with rifampicin. Rifaximin treatment resulted in significant induction of PXR target genes in the intestine of hPXR mice, but not in wild-type and Pxr-null mice. However, rifaximin treatment demonstrated no significant effect on hepatic PXR target genes in wild-type, Pxr-null, and hPXR mice. Consistent with the in vivo data, cell-based reporter gene assay revealed rifaximin-mediated activation of human PXR, but not the other xenobiotic nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARgamma, and farnesoid X receptor. Pretreatment with rifaximin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrate midazolam, but it increased the C(max) and decreased T(max) of 1'-hydroxymidazolam. Collectively, the current study identified rifaximin as a gut-specific human PXR ligand, and it provided further evidence for the utility of hPXR mice as a critical tool for the study of human PXR activators. Further human studies are suggested to assess the potential role of rifaximin-mediated gut PXR activation in therapeutics of chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
17442976	Cross-regulation of carbon monoxide and the adenosine A2a receptor in macrophages.	Adenosine and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) exert a wide range of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, making them crucial regulatory molecules. Despite the diversity in their modes of action, the similarity of biological effects of adenosine and HO-1 led us to hypothesize a possible interrelationship between them. We assessed a potential role for HO-1 in the ability of adenosine or 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), a stable adenosine analog, to modify the response of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Adenosine and NECA markedly induced HO-1 and blocked LPS-induced TNF-alpha production via adenosine A2aR-mediated signaling; blocking of HO-1 by RNA interference abrogated the effects of adenosine and NECA on TNF-alpha. HO-1 overexpression or exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), a product of HO-1 enzymatic activity, resulted in augmented A2aR mRNA and protein levels in RAW264.7 cells and primary macrophages. The induction of A2aR expression by HO-1 or CO resulted in an increase in the sensitivity to the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine and NECA, which was lost in macrophages isolated from A2aR-deficient mice. Moreover, a decrease in cAMP levels upon NECA stimulation of naive macrophages was counterbalanced by CO exposure to up-regulate A2aR levels. This implies adenosine receptor isoform switch as a selective modification in macrophage phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop among adenosine, HO-1, CO, and the A2aR in the chronological resolution of the inflammatory response.
17445919	A paradoxical effect of lidocaine for the N406S mutation of SCN5A associated with Brugada syndrome.	Accelerated intermediate inactivation, which is caused by mutations in the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit gene (SCN5A), is one of the molecular mechanisms underlying Brugada syndrome. The N406S mutation associated with Brugada syndrome results in the accelerated intermediate inactivation, in addition to unique pharmacological characteristics.
17455212	Polymorphisms in dopamine receptor DRD1 and DRD2 genes and psychopathological and extrapyramidal symptoms in patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment.	DRD(1) and DRD(2) receptor gene variants have been associated with clinical aspects of schizophrenia; however only specific features were analyzed in different samples. To assess the complex interaction between genetic and clinical factors, we studied the possible cross-interactions between DRD1 and DRD2 dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms, symptomatology of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, and the occurrence of treatment induced side effects taking into consideration possible clinical confounding variables. One hundred thirty one outpatients in stable remission meeting the DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders and receiving long-term maintenance therapy with haloperidol, fluphenazine, zuclopenthixole, or risperidone were genotyped for DRD1 A-48G, DRD2 Ins-141CDel, and DRD2 Ser311Cys polymorphisms. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the positive and negative syndrome scale for schizophrenia (PANSS). Extrapyramidal side effects were assessed with the Simpson-Angus extrapyramidal side effects scale (EPS), the Barnes Akathisia scale (BARS), and the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS). Drug dosage was included as covariant because it was associated with the severity of symptomatology, akathisia, and parkinsonism. No association was observed for DRD1 and DRD2 polymorphisms and extrapyramidal side effects, or with the other clinical variables considered. Our study suggests that DRD1 and DRD2 variants are not liability factors for tardive dyskinesia.
17456683	Amitriptyline is a potent blocker of human Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels.	Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels control excitability of neuronal cells. As hyperexcitability is a sign of neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders, these channels may be important molecular targets of amitriptyline that cause pharmacological as well as toxicological effects by altering neuronal excitability. Since the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects of amitriptyline have not been fully elucidated, we aimed to characterize the interaction of amitriptyline with human Kv1.1 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels. We also intended to establish the interaction of amitriptyline with the Kv7.2/7.3 channel opener, retigabine.
17458563	Predictive factors for long-term effects of imatinib therapy in patients with inoperable/metastatic CD117(+) gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).	To analyze the outcomes of treatment and factors predicting effects of imatinib (IM) therapy in inoperable/metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) CD117(+) patients.
17460608	Genetic variation in the renal sodium transporters NKCC2, NCC, and ENaC in relation to the effects of loop diuretic drugs.	There is little data on genetic predictors of loop diuretic efficacy in humans. Therefore, we investigated the diuretic effects of single oral doses of bumetanide, frusemide, and torsemide in a crossover study in 97 healthy Caucasians in relation to genetic variation in the renal sodium transporters NKCC2 (coded by SLC12A1), NCC (SLC12A3), and ENaC (three subunits coded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). The NCC alanine 264 allele (Gly264Ala) and the most frequent SCNN1B haplotype were associated with stronger diuresis, indicating lower reabsorbing function of these alleles. The variant alleles of the tightly coupled polymorphisms rs5723 (Leu649Leu) and rs5729 in SCNN1G were associated with weaker diuresis, indicating higher activity. Extended haplotype homozygosity implied evolutionary selection of the NCC alanine 264 allele. In conclusion, acute diuretic effects of loop diuretics were affected by genetic variation in sodium transporters that, in the nephron, are located distally from NKCC2.
17474542	Monitoring effects of direct FXa-inhibitors with a new one-step prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) assay: comparative in vitro investigation with heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux and DX 9065a.	Selective, direct factor Xa-inhibitors are an emerging new class of antithrombotic drugs but their application in therapy may require adequate laboratory monitoring. A recently introduced assay for monitoring anti-FXa-activity using Russell's viper venom is based on the prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT). In this study comparative data on the performance of PiCT using direct and indirect FXa-inhibitors and measurements of FXa-activity and aPTT are reported.
17485303	Rat ovulation, implantation and decidualization are severely compromised by COX-2 inhibitors.	Although Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is essential for mouse ovulation, fertilization, implantation and decidualization, the regulation and function of COX-2 in rat reproduction are still unknown. This study was designed to examine the action of COX-2 in rat ovulation, implantation and decidualization by using two specific inhibitors of COX-2 (nimesulide and niflumic acid). Compared to control, either nimesulide or niflumic acid significantly inhibited the ovulation in the superovulated rats. Although nimesulide had no obvious effects on the number of implantation sites and the vascular permeability, the expression of PPARdelta, HB-EGF and vimentin proteins was down-regulated in the nimesulide-treated groups. COX-1 protein was upregulated by nimesulide treatment. Nimesulide also had an inhibitory effect on decidualization during early pregnancy and under artificial decidualization. Moreover, nimesulide caused the increase of the gestation period and the reduction of litter size and birth weight compared to controls. Based on our data, rat implantation and decidualization were delayed by nimesulide treatment, resulting in the reduction of litter size and birth weight and the prolongation of gestational length, suggesting that COX-2 plays an important role in implantation and decidualization.
17486546	Spatiotemporal expression of the creatine metabolism related genes agat, gamt and ct1 during zebrafish embryogenesis.	Glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT or GATM), guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) and creatine transporter (CT1) are three proteins involved in the synthesis and uptake of creatine. The expression patterns of these three genes were examined in zebrafish embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization followed by histological sectioning. Expression of agat first appeared in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) at the gastrula stage and was progressively up regulated during gastrulation. As development proceeds, agat was expressed in the mature somites during the segmentation stage and in the liver at 48 hpf. gamt showed a similar expression pattern to that of agat during embryogenesis. It was first detected in the center of the yolk from the cleavage to the gastrula stage. At the bud stage, its expression shifted to the YSL. gamt was also transiently expressed in the mature somites from 16 hpf to 24 hpf and became strongly expressed in the liver and in epithelial cells of the gut at 48 hpf. ct1 was initially uniformly expressed from the cleavage to the early segmentation stage; it was then strongly expressed in all the somites till 30 hpf and in the gut of 48 hpf embryos. However, ct1 transcripts also appeared in the central nervous system during the segmentation stage, but not in the YSL, the yolk or the liver. Our data reveal for the first time distinct and unique patterns of expression of the creatine metabolism genes agat, gamt and ct1 during zebrafish embryogenesis.
17498959	Sulfated glucosamine inhibits MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions in human fibrosarcoma cells.	In the present study, sulfated glucosamine (SGlc) that has been reported to relieve joint pain and inflammation in many arthritis patients was studied for its inhibitory effects on MMP-2 and MMP-9 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Expression and activity of above MMPs studied using gelatin zymography suggested SGlc as a potent MMP inhibitor. Further, transfection of promoter genes of MMPs and their transcription factors clearly exhibited that inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was due to down-regulation of transcription factor, NF-kappaB. However expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1), another important transcription factor of MMPs, was not affected by SGlc treatment. In addition, protein expression results of Western blot analysis were also in agreement with the results of gene transfection experiments. Moreover, down-regulation of NF-kappaB resulted in production of low levels of both NF-kappaB p50 and p65 proteins and directly affected activation process of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions. Since MMPs involve in joint inflammation, it can be presumed that inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 can be one of the mechanisms of SGlc to be an effective drug in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis.
17502428	Pharmacological characterization of glycine-activated currents in HEK 293 cells expressing N-methyl-D-aspartate NR1 and NR3 subunits.	N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are important targets for drugs of abuse such as ethanol, toluene, and ketamine. Ligand-gated ion channels assembled from the NR1 and NR3 subunits have functional and pharmacological properties that are distinct from those of conventional NMDA receptors containing NR2 subunits. In the present study we used voltage-clamp electrophysiology to characterize excitatory glycine-activated receptors assembled from NR1, NR3A, and NR3B subunits expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. These glycine-activated receptors were not stimulated by glutamate or kainic acid and were resistant to magnesium block. A wide variety of NMDA receptor antagonists including d-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, ifenprodil, memantine, (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) or acamprosate did not inhibit glycine-activated NR1/NR3A/NR3B receptors. Likewise, these receptors were not affected by antagonists of inhibitory glycine receptors or glycine transporters. The NMDA receptor glycine site agonist, d-serine, partially activated NR1/NR3A/NR3B receptors, whereas the antagonist, 5,7-dichloro-kynurenic acid, inhibited receptor currents. Conversely, the antagonist, 7-chlorokynurenic acid, and the partial agonist, R-(+)-3-amino-1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone (HA-966), potentiated glycine-stimulated currents of these receptors. NR1/NR3A/NR3B receptor currents were inhibited by 10 to 21% by ethanol and toluene but were relatively insensitive to ketamine. Ethanol inhibition was enhanced in receptors expressing the NR1(L819A) mutant, whereas those containing NR1(F639A) or NR1(M813A) showed no change relative to the wild-type NR1. The results of this study indicate that coexpression of NR1, NR3A, and NR3B subunits in HEK 293 cells results in glycineactivated receptors with novel functional and pharmacological properties.
17506934	Minocycline inhibits 5-lipoxygenase activation and brain inflammation after focal cerebral ischemia in rats.	To determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of minocycline on postischemic brain injury is mediated by the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) expression and enzymatic activation in rats.
17513393	Copper deficiency decreases plasma homocysteine in rats.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of copper deficiency on key aspects of homocysteine metabolism that involve methionine recycling and transsulfuration. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed AIN-93G-based diets containing <1 or approximately 6 mg Cu/kg. After 6 wk (Expt. 1) and 4 wk (Expt. 2) we found that plasma homocysteine was significantly decreased, and plasma glutathione significantly increased, in rats fed the low-Cu diet. Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of the subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl) in liver that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis. The expression of Gclc, the catalytic subunit of Gcl, was upregulated by Cu deficiency; Gclm, the modifier subunit, was not affected. Hepatic betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (Bhmt), which catalyzes one of the two ways that homocysteine can be remethylated to methionine, was downregulated by Cu deficiency. Because Cu deficiency results in upregulation of Gclc and an increase in the biosynthesis of glutathione, it is plausible that the net flux of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is increased. Furthermore, if Bhmt is downregulated, less homocysteine is available for remethylation (methionine recycling) and more is then available to irreversibly enter the transsulfuration pathway where it is lost. The net effect of increased Gclc and decreased Bhmt would be a decrease in homocysteine as a result of Cu deficiency.
17516707	Comparison of Lornoxicam and Rofecoxib in Patients with Activated Osteoarthritis (COLOR Study).	Impaired mobility and pain mean a loss of quality of life for patients with rheumatic diseases. Therefore the initial aim of therapy is rapid and efficient analgesia in order to achieve the best possible result for these patients. Lornoxicam is a strong analgesic and anti-inflammatory NSAID with balanced cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1/COX-2 inhibition and excellent tolerability. In the course of the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors, it was maintained that COX-2 inhibitors decrease the risk of injury to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a similar efficacy to that of classic NSAIDs. However, a clinical trial comparing both substances has never been performed. In the present study we investigated the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis with lornoxicam in comparison with treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib. This multicentre clinical investigation focused on efficacy and tolerability.
17521299	Cyclooxygenase inhibition attenuates 3-nitropropionic acid-induced neurotoxicity in rats: possible antioxidant mechanisms.	Systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a complex II inhibitor of the electron transport chain, causes motor and cognitive deficits that are associated with excitotoxicity and excessive free radical generation. Recently, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors have been implicated as a neuroprotectant in the treatment of various neurological disorders. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of COX inhibitors in 3-NP-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 3-NP (20 mg/kg for 4 days) showed motor abnormalities and cognitive impairment in rats. Chronic treatment with naproxen (10 and 20 mg/kg) and valdecoxib (5 and 10 mg/kg) once daily for a period of 8 days beginning 4 days prior to 3-NP administration significantly improved 3-NP-induced motor and cognitive impairment in rats. Biochemical analysis revealed that systemic 3-NP administration significantly increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels, depleted reduced glutathione levels and reduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in the brains of rats, whereas administration of naproxen, a nonselective COX inhibitor (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) and valdecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (5 and 10 mg/kg p.o.) significantly attenuated 3-NP-induced oxidative stress. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors also significantly restored the decreased SDH activity. The results of the present study clearly indicate that naproxen and valdecoxib showed protection against 3-NP-induced motor and cognitive impairment by decreasing oxidative stress.
17524933	An assay for the determination of sirolimus levels in the lymphocyte of transplant patients.	Both tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SRL) bind to the same immunophilin FKBP12; however, their mechanisms of action are distinct. SRL inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR), which is an enzyme critical to the immune function. TOR inhibition blocks the signal that mediates T-cell proliferation by preventing cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Moreover, TOR inhibition results in a decrease in antibody production by blocking B-cell proliferation and maturation into antibody producing cells. The use of SRL has resulted in a decrease in the number of rejection episodes. As with other immunosuppressive agents, SRL can cause dose-related side effects, the most notable of which are hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring to assess efficacy and toxicity has became a necessity. SRL blood levels do not correlate with its bioactivity and are affected by the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive drugs. To determine the bioactivity of SRL we have developed an assay to determine the level of Sirolimus per lymphocyte of transplant patients. The levels were correlated with lymphocyte count.
17526944	In vivo inhibition of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression by dexamethasone parallels induction of the negative transcription factor DAX-1.	In this study, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on the synthesis of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and the expression of DAX-1 (dosage sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) and SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1) in vivo. Male rats were treated with dexamethasone (0.4 and 4 mg/kg body wt per day) by intraperitoneal injections using phosphate-buffered saline as the vehicle for 7 d. At the end of 7 d, serum testosterone levels were decreased. Response to luteinizing hormone (LH) and 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP (8-Br-cAMP) in vitro was reduced in testicular cells isolated from dexamethasone-treated rat testes. Dexamethasone decreased LH-stimulated cAMP production. The conversion of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione to testosterone was not affected by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone increased DAX-1 expression and concordantly decreased StAR protein and mRNA in testicular cells. The increase in DAX-1 protein corresponded to a 57% reduction in StAR mRNA levels concomitant with a 79% reduction in serum testosterone levels. Dexamethasone had no effect on the level of SF-1, but increased the amount of complexed DAX-1-SF-1. Dexamethasone in vitro suppressed StAR promoter activity when an increasing amount of DAX-1 cDNA was transfected. These results demonstrate that dexamethasone increases expression of DAX-1, which results in increased amounts of complexed DAX-1-SF-1, in the absence of any change in the expression of SF-1. These observations strongly support the concept that dexamethasone suppresses rat testicular testosterone production, at least in part, by increasing the amount of complexed DAX-1-SF-1 in these cells, which leads directly to decreased availability of free SF-1 and, therefore, decreased activation of transcription of the rat StAR gene.
17537059	Plasma protein binding properties to immobilized heparin and heparin-albumin conjugate.	Selective adhesion of plasma proteins to immobilized heparin is considered to be beneficial regarding hemocompatibility of foreign materials in contact with blood. Prothrombin, thrombin, antithrombin III (AT3), and fibrinogen were selected for analysis in an experimental model. Biomolecular interaction analysis employing surface plasmon resonance was utilized to record and analyze their binding properties in real time. Biotinylated heparin, heparin-albumin conjugate, and albumin, respectively, were immobilized onto streptavidin-coated sensors as ligands. Prothrombin did not bind to any of the ligand surfaces and no specific binding of any of the plasma proteins to albumin was observed. Binding kinetics of thrombin to heparin and to heparin-albumin conjugate were calculated using two different methods. For heparin, identical K(D)(equilibrium dissociation constant) values of 61 x 10(-9) M were obtained with both methods. For the conjugate, only slightly different K(D) values of 111 x 10(-9) and 104 x 10(-9) M, respectively, were calculated. The affinity of thrombin toward the heparin-coated surface proved to be higher than its affinity toward the heparin conjugate. The binding pattern of AT3 to both heparin and heparin-albumin conjugate, although specific, was biphasic, possibly due to a conformational change during the binding process. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed a K(D) value of 281 +/- 24 x 10(-9) M for the heparin surface. For the conjugate surface, a K(D) of 53 +/- 5 x 10(-9) M was calculated, indicating a higher affinity toward heparin-albumin conjugate. A high-affinity binding of fibrinogen to high-density surfaces of both heparin and the conjugate was observed. However, as binding to low-density surfaces was considerably reduced, specificity remained uncertain.
17545544	Sorafenib inhibits imatinib-resistant KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta gatekeeper mutants.	Targeting of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases by imatinib is an effective anticancer strategy. However, mutations of the gatekeeper residue (T670 in KIT and T681 in PDGFRbeta) render the two kinases resistant to imatinib. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a multitargeted ATP-competitive inhibitor of KIT and PDGFR, was active against imatinib-resistant KIT and PDGFRbeta kinases.
17553470	The differential effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation on dopamine receptor-mediated abnormal involuntary movements and rotations in the primed hemiparkinsonian rat.	Serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)R) agonists have emerged as valuable supplements to l-DOPA therapy, demonstrating that they can decrease side effects and enhance motor function in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and human PD patients. The precise mechanism by which these receptors act remains unknown and there is limited information on how 5-HT(1A)R stimulation impacts striatal dopamine (DA) D1 receptor (D1R) and D2 receptor (D2R) function. The current study examined the effects of 5-HT(1A)R stimulation on DA receptor-mediated behaviors. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered hemiparkinsonian by unilateral 6-OHDA lesions and primed with the D1R agonist SKF81297 (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) in order to sensitize DA receptors. Using a randomized within subjects design, rats received a first injection of: Vehicle (dH(2)O) or the 5-HT(1A)R agonist +/-8-OH-DPAT (0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), followed by a second injection of: Vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), the D1R agonist SKF81297 (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.), the D2R agonist quinpirole (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.), or l-DOPA (12 mg/kg+benserazide, 15 mg/kg, i.p.). On test days, rats were monitored over a 2-h period immediately following the second injection for abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), analogous to dyskinesia observed in PD patients, and contralateral rotations. The present findings indicate that 5-HT(1A)R stimulation reduces AIMs induced by D1R, D2R and l-DOPA administration while its effects on DA agonist-induced rotations were receptor-dependent, suggesting that direct 5-HT(1A)R and DA receptor interactions may contribute to the unique profile of 5-HT(1A)R agonists for the improvement of PD treatment.
17555598	Alefacept (anti-CD2) causes a selective reduction in circulating effector memory T cells (Tem) and relative preservation of central memory T cells (Tcm) in psoriasis.	Alefacept (anti-CD2) biological therapy selectively targets effector memory T cells (Tem) in psoriasis vulgaris, a model Type 1 autoimmune disease.
17558310	The 1976C>T polymorphism in the adenosine A2A receptor gene does not affect the vasodilator response to adenosine in humans in vivo.	The 1976C>T polymorphism in the adenosine A2A receptor gene (ADORA2A) modulates the psychological response to administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. We quantified the vascular response to adenosine and caffeine to determine the relevance of this variant allele in the physiological response to these agents. We selected 10 study participants with the TT genotype and 10 CC controls, matched for activities of other proteins involved in the metabolism of adenosine. The vasodilator response to the intrabrachial administration of adenosine (0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 15.0, and 50.0 microg/min/dl; venous occlusion plethysmography) was not different between the groups (P=0.4). In addition, the effect of subsequent administration of caffeine (90 microg/min/dl) was not different (P=0.7). We conclude that the 1976C>T polymorphism does not affect the vascular response to adenosine and caffeine in humans in vivo. Therefore, this polymorphism does not contribute to the variation in the effects of adenosine receptor stimulation.
17559139	A prospective analysis of imatinib-induced c-KIT modulation in ovarian cancer: a phase II clinical study with proteomic profiling.	c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are potential molecular targets in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Imatinib inhibits the kinase domain and subsequent downstream signaling of these receptor tyrosine kinases. The objective of this study was to investigate biochemical and biologic effects of imatinib on EOC.
17559790	Specific derivatization of the vesicle monoamine transporter with novel carrier-free radioiodinated reserpine and tetrabenazine photoaffinity labels.	Two iodophenylazide derivatives of reserpine and one iodophenylazide derivative of tetrabenazine have been synthesized and characterized as photoaffinity labels of the vesicle monoamine transporter (VMAT2). These compounds are 18-O-[3-(3'-iodo-4'-azidophenyl)-propionyl]methyl reserpate (AIPPMER), 18-O-[N-(3'-iodo-4'-azidophenethyl)glycyl]methyl reserpate (IAPEGlyMER), and 2-N-[(3'-iodo-4'-azidophenyl)-propionyl]tetrabenazine (TBZ-AIPP). Inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake into purified chromaffin granule ghosts showed IC50 values of approximately 37 nM for reserpine, 83 nM for AIPPMER, 200 nM for IAPEGlyMER, and 2.1 microM for TBZ-AIPP. Carrier-free radioiodinated [125I]IAPEGlyMER and [125I]TBZ-AIPP were synthesized and used to photoaffinity label chromaffin granule membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed specific [125I]IAPEGlyMER labeling of a polypeptide that migrated as a broad band (approximately 55-90 kDa), with the majority of the label located between 70 and 80 kDa. The labeling by [125I]IAPEGlyMER was blocked by 100 nM reserpine, 10 microM tetrabenazine, 1 mM serotonin, and 10 mM (-)-norepinephrine and dopamine. Analysis of [125I]TBZ-AIPP-labeled chromaffin granule membranes by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated specific labeling of a similar polypeptide, which was blocked by 1 microM reserpine and 10 microM tetrabenazine. Incubation of [125I]TBZ-AIPP-photolabeled chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of the glycosidase N-glycanase shifted the apparent molecular weight of VMAT2 to approximately 51 kDa. These data indicate that [125I]IAPEGlyMER and [125I]TBZ-AIPP are effective photoaffinity labels for VMAT2.
17573046	Overexpression of D2/D3 receptors increases efficacy of ropinirole in chronically 6-OHDA-lesioned Parkinsonian rats.	Ropinirole, which is a non-ergot dopamine agonist derivative, exerts therapeutic benefits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on recent studies implicating dopamine receptors 2 and 3 (D2R and D3R) as possible targets of ropinirole, we over-expressed these dopamine receptor genes in the dopamine-denervated striatum of rodents to reveal whether their over-expression modulated ropinirole activity. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats initially received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the medial forebrain bundle. At 1 month after surgery, successfully lesioned animals (3 or less forelimb akinesia score, and 8 or more apomorphine-induced rotations/min over 1 h) were randomly assigned to intrastriatal injection (ipsilateral to the lesion) of blank lentiviral vector, D2R, D3R or both genes. At about 5 months post-lesion, ropinirole (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered daily for 9 consecutive days. The subtherapeutic dose of ropinirole improved the use of previously akinetic forelimb and produced robust circling behavior in lesioned animals with striatal over-expression of both D2R and D3R compared to lesioned animals that received blank vector. In contrast, the subtherapeutic dose of ropinirole generated only modest motor effects in lesioned animals with sole over-expression of D2R or D3R. Western immunoblot and autoradiographic assays showed enhanced D2R and D3R protein levels coupled with normalized D2R and D3R binding in the ventral striatum of lesioned animals with lentiviral over-expression of both D2R and D3R relative to vehicle-treated lesioned animals. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that D2R and D3R GFP fluorescent cells colocalized with enkephalin and substance P immunoreactive medium spiny neurons. These data support the use of the subtherapeutic dose of ropinirole in a chronic model of PD.
17573128	COX-2 in play at the AHA and the FDA.	The inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 confers a small but absolute risk of cardiovascular events on patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This risk has been established by placebo-controlled trials of NSAIDs selective for COX-2; traditional NSAIDs seem to be heterogeneous with respect to cardiovascular risk. The American Heart Association (AHA) has proposed a 'stepped-care' approach to the use of NSAIDs in patients with cardiovascular disease, whereas the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has failed to approve the COX-2-selective NSAID etoricoxib. In this article, these actions of the AHA and the FDA are interpreted in the light of current knowledge, prompting the formulation of scientific questions that might be addressed.
17575107	Sorafenib inhibits the angiogenesis and growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts in nude mice.	Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains one of the most lethal human cancers. We hypothesized that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the BRaf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta kinase, would decrease tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of ATC. The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined. To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily. Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied. Sorafenib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines. Sorafenib also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. As result, the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved. Sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the BRAF mutational status of thyroid tumors. Given the lack of curative options for patients with ATC, sorafenib warrants further study as a therapeutic agent against ATC.
17575216	Expression of erythropoietin receptor and in vitro functional effects of epoetins in B-cell malignancies.	Erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptor (EPO-R) expression have been reported in solid tumors and are claimed to regulate tumor growth; however, no data have been published on this issue in B-cell malignancies or normal lymphoid cells. This report describes genomic/protein EPO-R expression and in vitro effects of recombinant human EPO (epoetin) in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), and multiple myeloma (MM).
17578914	Roles of DNA topoisomerase II isozymes in chemotherapy and secondary malignancies.	Drugs that target DNA topoisomerase II (Top2), including etoposide (VP-16), doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone, are among the most effective anticancer drugs in clinical use. However, Top2-based chemotherapy has been associated with higher incidences of secondary malignancies, notably the development of acute myeloid leukemia in VP-16-treated patients. This association is suggestive of a link between carcinogenesis and Top2-mediated DNA damage. We show here that VP-16-induced carcinogenesis involves mainly the beta rather than the alpha isozyme of Top2. In a mouse skin carcinogenesis model, the incidence of VP-16-induced melanomas in the skin of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-treated mice is found to be significantly higher in TOP2beta(+) than in skin-specific top2beta-knockout mice. Furthermore, VP-16-induced DNA sequence rearrangements and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are found to be Top2beta-dependent and preventable by cotreatment with a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting the importance of proteasomal degradation of the Top2beta-DNA cleavage complexes in VP-16-induced DNA sequence rearrangements. VP-16 cytotoxicity in transformed cells expressing both Top2 isozymes is, however, found to be primarily Top2alpha-dependent. These results point to the importance of developing Top2alpha-specific anticancer drugs for effective chemotherapy without the development of treatment-related secondary malignancies.
17588330	Effects of (-)-stepholidine on NMDA receptors: comparison with haloperidol and clozapine.	To examine whether (-)-stepholidine (SPD) has a direct effect on the N-methyl- D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR) containing the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A or NR2B and to compare its effect with those of haloperidol (Hal) and clozapine (Cloz).
17588331	Verapamil blocks HERG channel by the helix residue Y652 and F656 in the S6 transmembrane domain.	The objectives of this study were to investigate the inhibitory action of verapamil on wild-type(WT) and mutation HERG K+ channel current (I(HERG)), and to determine whether mutations in the S6 region are important for the inhibition of I(HERG) by verapamil.
17591676	Dehydroepiandrosterone induces human CYP2B6 through the constitutive androstane receptor.	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the major precursor of androgens and estrogens, has several beneficial effects on the immune system, on memory function, and in modulating the effects of diabetes, obesity, and chemical carcinogenesis. Treatment of rats with DHEA influences expression of cytochrome P450 (P450) genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha)- and pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated induction of CYP4As and CYP3A23, and suppression of CYP2C11. DHEA treatment elevated the expression and activities of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Induction of CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes was consistent with studies in rats, but induction of CYP2Cs was unexpected. The role of PXR in this response was studied in transient transfection assays. DHEA activated hPXR in a concentration-dependent manner. Because CYP2B6 induction by DHEA in human hepatocytes might involve either PXR or constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation, we performed experiments in primary hepatocytes from CAR knockout mice and observed that CAR was required for maximal induction of Cyp2b10 by DHEA. Furthermore, CAR-mediated Cyp2b10 induction by DHEA was inhibited by the inverse agonist of CAR, androstanol (5 alpha-androstan-3 alpha-ol). Further evidence for CAR activation was provided by cytoplasmic/nuclear transfer of CAR upon DHEA treatment. Elucidation of CAR activation and subsequent induction of CYP2B6 by DHEA presented an additional mechanism by which the sterol can modify the expression of P450s. The effect of DHEA on the activation of the xenosensors PPAR alpha, PXR, and CAR, and the consequent potential for adverse drug/toxicant interactions should be considered in humans treated with this nutriceutical agent.
17592198	Mitiglinide, a novel oral hypoglycemic agent, preserves the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning in isolated perfused rat hearts.	Diabetic patients often have manifestation of coronary heart disease. As a consequence, therapeutic strategies for diabetes should pay more attention to hypoglycemic agents which do not have adverse effects on myocardium. Mitiglinide is considered to have little or no impact on the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning (IP) because of its high selectivity for blocking sulfonylurea receptor1 (SUR1). However, glibenclamide, a nonselective SUR blocker, attenuates this beneficial effect. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mitiglinide preserves the protective action of IP evaluated by ischemia/reperfusion ventricular tachyarrhythmia (rVT) in isolated perfused rat hearts. After initial perfusion, the hearts were assigned to one of the following groups: 1) non-IP with control perfusion buffer (non-IP group); 2) IP with control perfusion buffer (IP-C group); 3) IP with perfusion buffer containing glibenclamide (IP-G group); and 4) IP with perfusion buffer containing mitiglinide (IP-M group). The protocol for the non-IP group consisted of 21 minutes of aerobic perfusion before 10 minutes of ischemia. In the other 3 groups (IP groups), there were 3 cycles of 2-minute ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion before 10 minutes of ischemia. The IP-C group had a significantly shorter rVT duration than the non-IP group (4.4 +/- 1.8 minutes versus 14.3 +/- 2.5 minutes; P < 0.05). rVT duration was the shortest in the IP-M group (3.9 +/- 1.0 minutes), but among the longest in the IP-G group (14.0 +/- 2.6 minutes). In conclusion, mitiglinide preserved the cardioprotective effect of IP, however, glibenclamide abolished this beneficial effect. Therefore, mitiglinide may offer a long-term benefit for myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients.
17610002	Arachidonic acid but not eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and oleic acid activates NF-kappaB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 cells.	In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB as well as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression, which is involved in recruiting leukocytes to the side of inflammation is increased. Moreover, colonic arachidonic acid (ARA) proportions are increased and oleic acid (OA) proportions are decreased. Fish oils are protective in IBD patients however, a side-by-side comparison between effects of fish oils, ARA and OA has not been made. We therefore, compared effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) versus ARA and OA on ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. To validate our model we showed that dexamethasone, sulfasalazine and PPARalpha (GW7647) or PPARgamma (troglitazone) agonists significantly lowered ICAM-1 expression. ICAM-1 expression of non-stimulated and cytokine stimulated Caco-2 cells cultured for 22 days with ARA was significant higher as compared to EPA and OA. Furthermore, ARA increased NF-kappaB activation in a reporter cell-line as compared to EPA. Antibody array analysis of multiple inflammatory proteins particularly showed an increased monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and angiogenin production and a decreased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 production by ARA as compared to EPA. Our results showed that ARA but not EPA and OA activates NF-kappaB and elevates ICAM-1 expression in Caco-2 enterocytes. It suggests that replacement of ARA by EPA or OA in the colon mucosa might have beneficial effects for IBD patients. Finally, we suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of ARA versus EPA and OA are not related to PPARgamma activation and/or eicosanoid formation.
17613539	Association of attentional network function with exon 5 variations of the CHRNA4 gene.	Mutational analyses in xenopus oocyte and mice models indicate that the positive effect of nicotine on attention may be modulated by genetic variations within exon 5 of the alpha4 subunit of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor gene CHRNA4. The potential relevance of exon 5 is further emphasized by two recent family-based association studies of nicotine dependence because subgroups of nicotine-dependent subjects are thought to 'self-medicate' attentional deficits with nicotine. We investigated a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): rs1044396, which has recently been associated with nicotine-dependence, plus two adjacent synonymous SNPs rs1044394 and rs1044393 in exon 5 of n = 47 unrelated healthy Caucasian subjects (age: 22.7 +/- 1.7 years; sex: n = 23 males; regular smokers: n = 19). Attentional network function was assessed in supplementary motor area/anterior cingulate (SMA/ACC) and parietal cortex with functional magnetic resonance imaging during an attention-requiring visual oddball task. SNP rs1044396 showed genotype effects on attentional network function both in the SMA/ACC and parietal cortex in the absence of overt behavioral effects. In the parietal cortex, a gene-dosage effect was seen. Comparable genotype effects were also found for the other two SNPs. This investigation provides first evidence that attentional network function may be modulated by genetic variations within CHRNA4 exon 5. If confirmed, future studies need to address what 'functional' polymorphisms are causative for the observed effects.
17628506	Response to lithium augmentation in depression is associated with the glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta -50T/C single nucleotide polymorphism.	Glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3B) is a serine/threonine kinase which is directly inhibited by lithium. A -50T/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) localized within the promoter region of the GSK3B gene has previously been shown to be associated with response to lithium prophylaxis in bipolar disorder. This study investigates the association of the GSK3B -50T/C SNP and response to lithium augmentation in acutely depressed antidepressant nonresponders.
17631921	Intracellular cholesterol changes induced by translocator protein (18 kDa) TSPO/PBR ligands.	One of the main functions of the translocator protein (18 kDa) or TSPO, previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is the regulation of cholesterol import into mitochondria for steroid biosynthesis. In this paper we show that TSPO ligands induce changes in the distribution of intracellular cholesterol in astrocytes and fibroblasts. NBD-cholesterol, a fluorescent analog of cholesterol, was rapidly removed from membranes and accumulated into lipid droplets. This change was followed by a block of cholesterol esterification, but not by modification of intracellular cholesterol synthesis. NBD-cholesterol droplets were in part released in the medium, and increased cholesterol efflux was observed in [(3)H]cholesterol-prelabeled cells. TSPO ligands also induced a prominent shrinkage and depolarization of mitochondria and depletion of acidic vesicles with cytoplasmic acidification. Consistent with NBD-cholesterol changes, MTT assay showed enhanced accumulation of formazan into lipid droplets and inhibition of formazan exocytosis after treatment with TSPO ligands. The effects of specific TSPO ligands PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 were reproduced by diazepam, which binds with high affinity both TSPO and central benzodiazepine receptors, but not by clonazepam, which binds exclusively to GABA receptor, and other amphiphilic substances such as DIDS and propranolol. All these effects and the parallel immunocytochemical detection of TSPO in potentially steroidogenic cells (astrocytes) and non-steroidogenic cells (fibroblasts) suggest that TSPO is involved in the regulation and trafficking of intracellular cholesterol by means of mechanisms not necessarily related to steroid biosynthesis.
17636172	Effects of ACTH and expression of the melanocortin-2 receptor in the neonatal mouse testis.	ACTH has been shown to stimulate androgen production by the fetal/neonatal mouse testis through the melanocortin type 2 receptor (MC2R). This study was designed to localize the expression of MC2R in the neonatal mouse testis and characterize the effects of ACTH on testicular androgen production. Using immunohistochemistry, MC2R was localized to the fetal-type Leydig cell population of the neonatal testis. ACTH caused a time-dependent increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) and testosterone production by isolated cells with an increase in cAMP apparent in < 3 min. There was no additive effect of maximally stimulating doses of ACTH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Androgen production in response to ACTH and hCG was reduced by UO126 and dexamethasone, which are the inhibitors of ERK1/2 and phospholipase A2 respectively. Expression of mRNA encoding StAR was increased fourfold by both ACTH and hCG, although expression of mRNA encoding for steroidogenic enzymes was not markedly affected. The potency of N-terminal fragments of ACTH to stimulate androgen production was similar to that seen previously in the adrenal. Data indicate that both LH and ACTH, acting through their respective receptors, stimulate steroidogenesis by fetal-type Leydig cells via arachidonic acid, protein kinase A, and ERK1/2 activation of StAR.
17639997	Solamargine upregulation of Fas, downregulation of HER2, and enhancement of cytotoxicity using epirubicin in NSCLC cells.	Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not generally a chemosensitive tumor, and the mechanism of resistance to the relevant anticancer drugs has not been fully elucidated. Solamargine (SM), the major steroidal glycoalkaloids extracted from the Chinese herb Solanum, inhibits the growth of human tumor cells. We have previously demonstrated that SM regulates tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs)- and mitochondria-mediated pathways and sensitizes NSCLC cells to initiate apoptosis. Interestingly, this investigation reveals that SM up-regulated Fas expression and down-regulated the expression of HER2, whose overexpression is associated with resistance to drugs, and promotes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in NSCLC A549 and H441 cells. After treatment with SM, the expression of HER2 mRNA was correlated with the expression of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) mRNA. The combinatory use of low concentrations of SM with low-toxic topoisomerase II inhibitor epirubicin accelerated apoptotic cell death. Therefore, the downregulation of the HER2 and TOP2A expression by SM with epirubicin may partially explain the SM and epirubicin cytotoxicity synergy effect in NSCLC. Results of this study suggest that SM induces Fas and TNFR-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis and reduces HER2 expression. These findings provide the synergistic therapeutic interaction between SM and epirubicin, suggesting that such combinations may be effectively exploited in future human cancer clinical trials.
17653141	Influence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 1173C/T genotype on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in African-American and European-American patients on warfarin.	The association of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 1173C/T genotype and risk of hemorrhage among African Americans and European Americans is presented. This association was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for demographics, comorbidity, and time-varying covariates. Forty-four major and 203 minor hemorrhages occurred over 555 person-years among 446 patients (60.6+/-15.6 years, 50% men, 227 African Americans). The variant CYP2C9 genotype conferred an increased risk for major (hazard ratio (HR) 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-8.0) but not minor (HR 1.3; 95% CI: 0.8-2.1) hemorrhage. The risk of major hemorrhage was 5.3-fold (95% CI: 0.4-64.0) higher before stabilization of therapy, 2.2-fold (95% CI: 0.7-6.5) after stabilization, and 2.4-fold (95% CI: 0.8-7.4) during all periods when anticoagulation was not stable. The variant VKORC1 1173C/T genotype did not confer a significant increase in risk for major (HR 1.7; 95% CI: 0.7-4.4) or minor (HR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.3) hemorrhage. The variant CYP2C9 genotype is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage, which persists even after stabilization of therapy.
17659402	Mechanism of interaction of niflumic acid with heterologously expressed kidney CLC-K chloride channels.	CLC-K Cl(-) channels belong to the CLC protein family. In kidney and inner ear, they are involved in transepithelial salt transport. Mutations in ClC-Kb lead to Bartter's syndrome, and mutations in the associated subunit barttin produce Bartter's syndrome and deafness. We have previously found that 3-phenyl-CPP blocks hClC-Ka and rClC-K1 from the extracellular side in the pore entrance. Recently, we have shown that niflumic acid (NFA), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory fenamate, produces biphasic behavior on human CLC-K channels that suggests the presence of two functionally different binding sites: an activating site and a blocking site. Here, we investigate in more detail the interaction of NFA on CLC-K channels. Mutants that altered block by 3-phenyl-2-(p-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid (CPP) had no effect on NFA block, indicating that the inhibition binding site of NFA is different from that of 3-phenyl-CPP and flufenamic acid. Moreover, NFA does not compete with extracellular Cl(-) ions, suggesting that the binding sites of NFA are not located deep in the pore. Differently from ClC-Ka, on the rat homologue ClC-K1, NFA has only an inhibitory effect. We developed a quantitative model to describe the complex action of NFA on ClC-Ka. The model predicts that ClC-Ka possesses two NFA binding sites: when only one site is occupied, NFA increases ClC-Ka currents, whereas the occupation of both binding sites leads to channel block.
17699867	Sorafenib inhibits the imatinib-resistant KITT670I gatekeeper mutation in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	Resistance is commonly acquired in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with imatinib mesylate, often due to the development of secondary mutations in the KIT kinase domain. We sought to investigate the efficacy of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, against the commonly observed imatinib-resistant KIT mutations (KIT(V654A), KIT(T670I), KIT(D820Y), and KIT(N822K)) expressed in the Ba/F3 cellular system.
17715389	Nilotinib (formerly AMN107), a highly selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is effective in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase following imatinib resistance and intolerance.	Nilotinib, an orally bioavailable, selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is 30-fold more potent than imatinib in pre-clinical models, and overcomes most imatinib resistant BCR-ABL mutations. In this phase 2 open-label study, 400 mg nilotinib was administered orally twice daily to 280 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) after imatinib failure or intolerance. Patients had at least 6 months of follow-up and were evaluated for hematologic and cytogenetic responses, as well as for safety and overall survival. At 6 months, the rate of major cytogenetic response (Ph < or = 35%) was 48%: complete (Ph = 0%) in 31%, and partial (Ph = 1%-35%) in 16%. The estimated survival at 12 months was 95%. Nilotinib was effective in patients harboring BCR-ABL mutations associated with imatinib resistance (except T315I), and also in patients with a resistance mechanism independent of BCR-ABL mutations. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, and there was minimal cross-intolerance with imatinib. Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29% of patients; pleural or pericardial effusions were observed in 1% (none were severe). In summary, nilotinib is highly active and safe in patients with CML-CP after imatinib failure or intolerance. This clinical trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as ID no. NCT00109707.
1783326	[Effect of lisuride on experimental cerebral infarction in rats].	Lisuride is an ergot derivative with central dopaminergic (D2 agonistic) and serotonergic (5-HT1A agonistic) activity. The effect of lisuride on experimental cerebral infarction in rats was investigated. Cerebral infarction was induced by intracarotid infusion of a 50-microliters mixture in which deformed and rigid red blood cells treated with hypertonic solution were contained. Lisuride or 0.9% NaCl was administered subcutaneously 30 min before induction of cerebral infarction. Lisuride (0.01 mg/kg) not only prolonged the survival time of the animals but also suppressed cerebral edema, increase in the electrolytes content and histological damage in the brain. These results suggest that lisuride has a protective effect against cerebral infarction.
17851563	IMPDH1 gene polymorphisms and association with acute rejection in renal transplant patients.	Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the de novo pathway for purine synthesis and is a major target of the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid (MPA). Few variants of the IMPDH1 gene have been reported. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize IMPDH1 variants to determine whether genetic variation contributes to differences in MPA response and toxicity in transplant patients. Seventeen genetic variants were identified in the IMPDH1 gene with allele frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 42.7%. In this study, 191 kidney transplant patients who received mycophenolate mofetil were genotyped for IMPDH1. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2278293 and rs2278294, were significantly associated with the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection in the first year post-transplantation. Future studies of the multifactorial nature of acute rejection must consider IMPDH1 polymorphisms in MPA-treated patients.
17898305	Prevention of excitotoxicity in primary retinal ganglion cells by (+)-pentazocine, a sigma receptor-1 specific ligand.	Sigma receptors (sigmaRs) are nonopioid, nonphencyclidine binding sites with robust neuroprotective properties. Previously, the authors induced death in the RGC-5 cell line using very high concentrations (1 mM) of the excitatory amino acids glutamate (Glu) and homocysteine (Hcy) and demonstrated that the sigmaR1 ligand (+)-pentazocine ((+)-PTZ) could protect against cell death. The purpose of the present study was to establish a physiologically relevant paradigm for testing the neuroprotective effect of (+)-PTZ in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).
17912044	The monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine enhances the discriminative stimulus effect of nicotine in rats.	In addition to delivering nicotine, tobacco smoke also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO). Although MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) can increase nicotine self-administration in rodents, the effects of MAOIs on the discriminative stimulus effect of nicotine are not known. This study examined the effects of three MAOIs (phenelzine, clorgyline and pargyline) with varying selectivity for MAOA and MAOB in the nicotine drug discrimination procedure in rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate nicotine (0.3 mg/kg, subcutaneously) from saline in a standard, two-lever food-reinforced operant task. Once the discrimination was acquired, the ability of each MAOI to substitute for or alter the discriminative stimulus effect of nicotine was determined. In substitution tests, nicotine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) produced full, dose-dependent substitution. Although the selective MAOA inhibitor clorgyline (3-56 mg/kg) and the selective MAOB inhibitor pargyline (3-56 mg/kg) did not elicit any nicotine-appropriate responding, partial substitution was obtained with the nonselective MAO inhibitor phenelzine (1-17 mg/kg). Phenelzine (10 mg/kg) also enhanced the discriminative stimulus effect of a low dose of nicotine (0.056 mg/kg) and prolonged the time course effect of the nicotine-training dose. These findings indicate that concomitant inhibition of MAOA and MAOB can enhance the discriminative stimulus effect of nicotine in rats.
17995453	Complementary regulation of TBC1D1 and AS160 by growth factors, insulin and AMPK activators.	AS160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa) and TBC1D1 are related RabGAPs (Rab GTPase-activating proteins) implicated in regulating the trafficking of GLUT4 (glucose transporter 4) storage vesicles to the cell surface. All animal species examined contain TBC1D1, whereas AS160 evolved with the vertebrates. TBC1D1 has two clusters of phosphorylated residues, either side of the second PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding domain). Each cluster contains a 14-3-3-binding site. When AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is activated in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, 14-3-3s bind primarily to pSer237 (where pSer is phosphorylated serine) in TBC1D1, whereas 14-3-3 binding depends primarily on pThr596 (where pThr is phosphorylated threonine) in cells stimulated with IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), EGF (epidermal growth factor) and PMA; and both pSer237 and pThr596 contribute to 14-3-3 binding in cells stimulated with forskolin. In HEK-293 cells, LY294002 inhibits phosphorylation of Thr596 of TBC1D1, and promotes phosphorylation of AMPK and Ser237 of TBC1D1. In vitro phosphorylation experiments indicated regulatory interactions among phosphorylated sites, for example phosphorylation of Ser235 prevents subsequent phosphorylation of Ser237. In rat L6 myotubes, endogenous TBC1D1 is strongly phosphorylated on Ser237 and binds to 14-3-3s in response to the AMPK activators AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-D-ribofuranoside), phenformin and A-769662, whereas insulin promotes phosphorylation of Thr596 but not 14-3-3 binding. In contrast, AS160 is phosphorylated on its 14-3-3-binding sites (Ser341 and Thr642) and binds to 14-3-3s in response to insulin, but not A-769662, in L6 cells. These findings suggest that TBC1D1 and AS160 may have complementary roles in regulating vesicle trafficking in response to insulin and AMPK-activating stimuli in skeletal muscle.
18061638	Dienogest is a selective progesterone receptor agonist in transactivation analysis with potent oral endometrial activity due to its efficient pharmacokinetic profile.	Dienogest was introduced as an oral progestin. Yet its strong oral potency on endometrial activity is not clearly explained. To circumvent this situation, steroid hormone receptor profiling using transactivation assay and endometrial activity test in rabbits were carried out with determination of plasma drug concentration. Agonistic/antagonistic activity on human progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), or estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) were determined. Dienogest activate PR (EC50=3.4 or 10.5 nmol/l) with antagonistic activity on AR (EC50=420.6 or 775.0 nmol/l) but not agonistic nor antagonistic action on GR, MR (3000 nmol/l). Dienogest activate neither ERalpha nor ERbeta (3000 nmol/l). Progesterone activated PR with antagonistic activity on AR and on MR. Dydrogesterone showed a similar profile to progesterone. Norethisterone activated PR, AR, and ERalpha. Medroxyprogesterone acetate activated PR, AR, and GR. Danazol activated PR and AR. Collectively, dienogest has a good specificity to PR compared with the other drugs. By oral treatment, dienogest showed the strongest endometrial activity (ED50=0.0042 mg/kg) in McPhail test among other progestins (ED50 values for MPA, DYG, NES were 0.074, 1.9, >0.05 mg/kg, respectively). Dienogest showed higher plasma concentrations than those of the other progestins with higher doses. The estimated plasma concentration of dienogest at ED50 (3.66 nmol/l) was close to its EC50 value to activate PR. Thus, the stronger oral activity of dienogest could be explained simply by its in vitro potency on PR and its oral pharmacokinetic profile.
18077625	Reduction of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma expression by gamma-irradiation as a mechanism contributing to inflammatory response in rat colon: modulation by the 5-aminosalicylic acid agonist.	Radiation-induced intestinal injuries, including inflammation and immune response, remain a limiting factor in the effectiveness of pelvic radiotherapy and in the patient's quality of life during and after treatment. Peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists are now emerging as therapeutic drugs for various inflammatory diseases that are characterized by impaired PPAR expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the profile of PPAR expression in rat colonic mucosa 3 and 7 days after abdominal gamma-irradiation (10 Gy). We tested whether irradiation-induced acute inflammatory response could be modulated pharmacologically with the antiinflammatory properties of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) (250 mg/kg/day), which is a PPAR activator. Irradiation drastically reduced mRNA and protein levels of PPARalpha and -gamma and of the heterodimer retinoid X receptor (RXR)alpha at 3 days postirradiation. 5-ASA treatment normalized both PPARgamma and RXRalpha expression at 3 days postirradiation and PPARalpha at 7 days. By promoting PPAR expression and its nuclear translocation, 5-ASA interfered with the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway, both by reducing irradiation-induced NF-kappaB p65 translocation/activation and increasing the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor (IkappaB) mRNA and protein. Therefore, 5-ASA prevents irradiation-induced inflammatory processes as well as expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and macrophage infiltration. In addition, 5-ASA restores the interferon gamma/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT-3 concentrations that were impaired at 3 and 7 days postirradiation and are correlated with suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 repression. Collectively, these results indicate that PPAR agonists may be effective in the prevention of inflammatory processes and immune responses during and after pelvic radiotherapy.
18079279	Modulation of receptor phosphorylation contributes to activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha by dehydroepiandrosterone and other peroxisome proliferators.	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a C19 human adrenal steroid, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in vivo but does not ligand-activate PPARalpha in transient transfection experiments. We demonstrate that DHEA regulates PPARalpha action by altering both the levels and phosphorylation status of the receptor. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid encoding PPARalpha and a plasmid containing two copies of fatty acyl coenzyme oxidase (FACO) peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor responsive element consensus oligonucleotide in a luciferase reporter gene. Nafenopin treatment increased reporter gene activity in this system, whereas DHEA treatment did not. Okadaic acid significantly decreased nafenopin-induced reporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Okadaic acid treatment of primary rat hepatocytes decreased both DHEA- and nafenopin-induced FACO activity in primary rat hepatocytes. DHEA induced both PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels, as well as PP2A message in primary rat hepatocytes. Western blot analysis showed that the serines at positions 12 and 21 were rapidly dephosphorylated upon treatment with DHEA and nafenopin. Results using specific protein phosphatase inhibitors suggested that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is responsible for DHEA action, and protein phosphatase 1 might be involved in nafenopin induction. Mutation of serines at position 6, 12, and 21 to an uncharged alanine residue significantly increased transcriptional activity, whereas mutation to negative charged aspartate residues (mimicking receptor phosphorylation) decreased transcriptional activity. DHEA action involves induction of PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels as well as increased PPARalpha transcriptional activity through decreasing receptor phosphorylation at serines in the AF1 region.
18237195	Melatonin is a potent inhibitor for myeloperoxidase.	Myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the formation of potent oxidants that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, and cancer. Melatonin plays an important part in the regulation of various body functions including circadian sleep rhythms, blood pressure, oncogenesis, retinal function, seasonal reproduction, and immunity. Here, we demonstrate that melatonin serves as a potent inhibitor of MPO under physiological-like conditions. In the presence of chloride (Cl-), melatonin inactivated MPO at two points in the classic peroxidase cycle through binding to MPO to form an inactive complex, melatonin-MPO-Cl, and accelerating MPO compound II formation, an inactive form of MPO. Inactivation of MPO was mirrored by the direct conversion of MPO-Fe(III) to MPO compound II without any sign of compound I accumulation. This behavior indicates that melatonin binding modulates the formation of MPO intermediates and their decay rates. The Cl- presence enhanced the affinity of MPO toward melatonin, which switches the enzyme activity from peroxidation to catalase-like activity. In the absence of Cl-, melatonin served as a 1e- substrate for MPO compound I, but at higher concentration it limited the reaction by its dissociation from the corresponding complex. Importantly, melatonin-dependent inhibition of MPO occurred with a wide range of concentrations that span various physiological and supplemental ranges. Thus, the interplay between MPO and melatonin may have a broader implication in the function of several biological systems. This dual regulation by melatonin is unique and represents a new means through which melatonin can control MPO and its downstream inflammatory pathways.
18343915	Carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Insight into the characteristics of zonisamide, topiramate, and the sulfamide cognate of topiramate.	Some useful therapeutic agents inhibit certain carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes to varying degrees. We have conducted enzyme kinetics studies in a 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA) hydrolysis assay with the marketed antiepileptic drugs topiramate (1) and zonisamide (2) to determine if their full inhibition of human CA-II and CA-I requires extended preincubation conditions. We found that neither 1 nor 2 requires appreciable preincubation with either enzyme to manifest full inhibitory activity. We also examined the sulfamide cognate of topiramate (3) to characterize its CA inhibitory activity, and confirmed that it is a very weak inhibitor, unlike 1 or 2. In a CO(2) hydration assay, 3 behaved as a very weak, partial inhibitor of CA-II and CA-I. We conclude that topiramate (1), zonisamide (2), and sulfamide 3 do not require extended exposure to human CA-I or CA-II to manifest full inhibitory activity (4-NPA assay).
1838579	Characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A-like binding sites in human ganglioneuroblastoma.	Tumors derived from primitive neural crest cells are the most common malignant neoplasms of infancy and early childhood. We recently reported [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin specific binding in one such tumor, the ganglioneuroblastoma. We now characterize this binding and compare it with 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) sites in human and rat cortex. In competition studies, the rank order of drug affinities was suggestive of a 5-HT1A binding site: 5-HT greater than 8-OH-DPAT, RU24969 greater than methysergide, methiothepin, 1-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl aminopropane (DOI), ketanserin greater than mianserin. Regression analysis showed a correlation with drug affinities in human cortex. [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding was saturable and linear with absence of cooperativity, indicative of a single population of sites. The density of sites in ganglioneuroblastoma was two- to four-fold less than in human or rat cortex. [3H]5-HT binding also identified 5-HT1 binding sites in ganglioneuroblastoma, comparable in density to [3H]8-OH-DPAT-labelled sites. No specific binding was found using [3H]paroxetine, [3H]DOB, [3H]ketanserin, or [3H]mesulergine to label other types of 5-HT recognition sites. These data confirm the presence of a 5-HT1A-like binding site in human ganglioneuroblastoma.
18472336	Misoprostol, an anti-ulcer agent and PGE2 receptor agonist, protects against cerebral ischemia.	Induction of COX-2 activity in cerebral ischemia results in increased neuronal injury and infarct size. Recent studies investigating neurotoxic mechanisms of COX-2 demonstrate both toxic and paradoxically protective effects of downstream prostaglandin receptor signaling pathways. We tested whether misoprostol, a PGE(2) receptor agonist that is utilized clinically as an anti-ulcer agent and signals through the protective PGE(2) EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors, would reduce brain injury in the murine middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO-RP) model. Administration of misoprostol, at the time of MCAO or 2h after MCAO, resulted in significant rescue of infarct volume at 24 and 72h. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated dynamic regulation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors during reperfusion in neurons and endothelial cells of cerebral cortex and striatum, with limited expression of EP3 receptor. EP3-/- mice had no significant changes in infarct volume compared to control littermates. Moreover, administration of misoprostol to EP3+/+ and EP3-/- mice showed similar levels of infarct rescue, indicating that misoprostol protection was not mediated through the EP3 receptor. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel function for misoprostol as a protective agent in cerebral ischemia acting via the PGE(2) EP2 and/or EP4 receptors.
1847384	Hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis is coupled to mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors. Tropic hormone action on steroid biosynthesis is inhibited by flunitrazepam.	The mitochondrial (peripheral-type) benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) is a drug binding site associated with outer mitochondrial membranes which is coupled to intramitochondrial cholesterol transport, the rate-determining step of steroid biosynthesis. To examine the relationship between MBR function and steroid synthesis regulated by polypeptide hormones, the Y-1 adrenocortical and MA-10 Leydig cell lines were used as model systems responsive to adrenocorticotropin and human choriogonadotropin, respectively. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine which binds to MBR with high nanomolar affinity, inhibited the steroidogenic activity of these hormones, or the activation by 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP, in both cell lines by 30-60% with an IC50 of 500-1000 nM. Scatchard analysis in both cell lines revealed one class of specific binding sites for [3H] flunitrazepam verified as being MBR by displacement studies with a series of MBR ligands. The potencies of these ligands to compete against the antagonism of hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis by flunitrazepam correlated significantly with their abilities to compete against [3H]flunitrazepam binding to MBR (r = 0.99). An inhibition in pregnenolone formation was also observed in isolated mitochondrial preparations characterized as a reduction of cholesterol transport to inner mitochondrial membranes. These observations provide unequivocal evidence that the antagonistic action of flunitrazepam is mediated through its interaction with MBR demonstrating that these drug recognition sites are coupled to steroid biosynthesis activated by tropic hormones.
18501888	Inhibitory profiles of captopril on matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity.	To investigate the inhibitory profiles of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, the inhibitory activity and molecular interaction of captopril on human MMP-9 were studied. Plasma MMP-9 and ACE activities in samples from patient with acute myocardial infarction were similarly inhibited by captopril. Molecular models showed that captopril directly bound to the MMP-9 active center. Compared with the other ACE inhibitors, the compact structure of captopril seemed to make the inhibitory profiles on the MMP-9 active site.
18516076	Analysis of the mechanism by which melatonin inhibits human eosinophil peroxidase.	Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) catalyses the formation of oxidants implicated in the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases including allergy and asthma. Mechanisms for inhibiting EPO, once released, are poorly understood. The aim of this work is to determine the mechanisms by which melatonin, a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland, inhibits the catalytic activity of EPO.
18541897	Axitinib is an active treatment for all histologic subtypes of advanced thyroid cancer: results from a phase II study.	Patients with advanced, incurable thyroid cancer not amenable to surgery or radioactive iodine ((131)I) therapy have few satisfactory therapeutic options. This multi-institutional study assessed the activity and safety of axitinib, an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3 in patients with advanced thyroid cancer.
18544567	PPARgamma is involved in mesalazine-mediated induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth in colon cancer cells.	Mesalazine has been identified as a candidate chemopreventive agent in colon cancer prophylaxis because of its pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. However, the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood. The aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in mesalazine's anticarcinogenic actions in colorectal cancer cells.
18560757	Adenosine kinase and ribokinase--the RK family of proteins.	Ribokinase (RK) and adenosine kinase (AK) catalyze the phosphorylation of ribose and adenosine to ribose-5-phosphate and AMP, respectively. Belonging to the RK family of proteins, these enzymes share a number of unique structural and functional elements. Extensive work has been carried out on many aspects of these enzymes in recent years, and we summarize the wealth of information currently available on them. The topics covered include descriptions of the primary and three-dimensional structures of AK and RK, their phylogenetic relationships, biochemical aspects of these enzymes including their reaction mechanisms and ionic requirements, and also work on certain inhibitors of these enzymes. The cellular metabolism and transport of ribose and adenosine are also briefly discussed, as well as the beneficial effects of ribose and adenosine in physiology and how these effects can be harnessed for pharmacological purposes.
18600528	Trifluorothymidine induces cell death independently of p53.	Trifluorothymidine (TFT), a potent anticancer agent, inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) and is incorporated into the DNA, both events resulting in cell death. Cell death induction related to DNA damage often involves activation of p53. We determined the role of p53 in TFT cytotoxicity and cell death induction, using, respectively, the sulforhodamine B-assay and FACS analysis, in a panel of cell lines with either wild type, inactive, or mutated p53. Neither TFT cytotoxicity nor cell death induction changed with TFT exposure in cell lines with wt, inactive or mutated p53.
1863523	Stereoselectivity of (R)- and (S)-hexahydro-difenidol binding to neuroblastoma M1, cardiac M2, pancreatic M3, and striatum M4 muscarinic receptors.	(R)-Hexahydro-difenidol has a higher affinity for M1 receptors in NB-OK 1 cells, pancreas M3 and striatum M4 receptors (pKi 7.9 to 8.3) than for cardiac M2 receptors (pKi 7.0). (S)-Hexahydro-difenidol, by contrast, is nonselective (pKi 5.8 to 6.1). Our goal in the present study was to evaluate the importance of the hydrophobic phenyl, and cyclohexyl rings of hexahydro-difenidol for the stereoselectivity and receptor selectivity of hexahydro-difenidol binding to the four muscarinic receptors. Our results indicated that replacement of the phenyl ring of hexahydro-difenidol by a cyclohexyl group (----dicyclidol) and of the cyclohexyl ring by a phenyl moiety (----difenidol) induced a large (4- to 80-fold) decrease in binding affinity for all muscarinic receptors. Difenidol had a significant preference for M1, M3, and M4 over M2 receptors; dicyclidol, by contrast, had a greater affinity for M1 and M4 than for M2 and M3 receptors. The binding free energy decrease due to replacement of the phenyl and the cyclohexyl groups of (R)-hexahydro-difenidol by, respectively, a cyclohexyl and a phenyl moiety was almost additive in the case of M4 (striatum) binding sites. In the case of the cardiac M2, pancreatic M3, or NB-OK 1 M1 receptors the respective binding free energies were not completely additive. These results suggest that the four (R)-hexahydro-difenidol "binding moieties" (phenyl, cyclohexyl, hydroxy, and protonated amino group) cannot simultaneously form optimal interactions with the M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
18657662	Carvedilol increases blood pressure response to phenylephrine infusion in heart failure subjects with systolic dysfunction: evidence of improved vascular alpha1-adrenoreceptor signal transduction.	Alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR) stimulation produces smooth muscle contraction, vasoconstriction, and myocyte hypertrophy, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for alpha(1)-AR antagonists to reduce cardiac workload and myocardial hypertrophy. Preliminary reports suggest that vascular alpha(1)-ARs are desensitized in heart failure (HF) in a manner similar to myocardial beta(1)-ARs. We examined alpha(1)-AR signal transduction by repeat phenylephrine (PE) infusions in patients with HF receiving chronic carvedilol therapy.
18704368	The in vitro receptor profile of rotigotine: a new agent for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.	Rotigotine (Neupro) is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist developed for the once daily treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using a transdermal delivery system (patch) which provides patients with the drug continuously over 24 h. To fully understand the pharmacological actions of rotigotine, the present study determined its extended receptor profile. In standard binding assays, rotigotine demonstrated the highest affinity for dopamine receptors, particularly the dopamine D3 receptor (Ki=0.71 nM) with its affinities to other dopamine receptors being (Ki in nM): D4.2 (3.9), D4.7 (5.9), D5 (5.4), D2 (13.5), D4.4 (15), and D1 (83). Significant affinities were also demonstrated at alpha-adrenergic (alpha2B, Ki=27 nM) and serotonin receptors (5-HT1A Ki=30 nM). In newly developed reporter-gene assays for determination of functional activity, rotigotine behaved as a full agonist at dopamine receptors (rank order: D3>D2L>D1=D5>D4.4) with potencies 2,600 and 53 times higher than dopamine at dopamine D3 and D2L receptors, respectively. At alpha-adrenergic sites, rotigotine acted as an antagonist on alpha2B receptors. At serotonergic sites, rotigotine had a weak but significant agonistic activity at 5-HT1A receptors and a minor or nonexistent activity at other serotonin receptors. Thus, in respect to PD, rotigotine can be characterized as a specific dopamine receptor agonist with a preference for the D3 receptor over D2 and D1 receptors. In addition, it exhibits interaction with D4 and D5 receptors, the role of which in relation to PD is not clear yet. Among non-dopaminergic sites, rotigotine shows relevant affinity to only 5-HT1A and alpha2B receptors. Further studies are necessary to investigate the contribution of the different receptor subtypes to the efficacy of rotigotine in Parkinson's disease and possible other indications such as restless legs syndrome.
18794803	CRAF inhibition induces apoptosis in melanoma cells with non-V600E BRAF mutations.	Here, we identify a panel of melanoma lines with non-V600E mutations in BRAF. These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity.
18839173	Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.	Induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme that is involved in the biotransformation of more than 50% of all drugs, by xenobiotics is an important cause of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions in oncology. In addition to rifampicin and hyperforin, the anticancer drug paclitaxel has also been shown to be an inducer of CYP3A4 via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). We therefore screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction.
18948374	Metoclopramide stimulates catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretion from pheochromocytoma cells through activation of serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptors.	The gastroprokinetic agent metoclopramide is known to stimulate catecholamine secretion from pheochromocytomas. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanism of action of metoclopramide and expression of serotonin type 4 (5-HT(4)) receptors in pheochromocytoma tissues. Tissue explants, obtained from 18 pheochromocytomas including the tumor removed from a 46-year-old female patient who experienced life-threatening hypertension crisis after metoclopramide administration and 17 additional pheochromocytomas (9 benign and 8 malignant) were studied. Cultured pheochromocytoma cells derived from the patient who previously received metoclopramide were incubated with metoclopramide and various 5-HT(4) receptor ligands. In addition, total mRNAs were extracted from all the 18 tumors. Catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide concentrations were measured in pheochromocytoma cell incubation medium by HPLC and radioimmunological assays. In addition, expression of 5-HT(4) receptor mRNAs in the 18 pheochromocytomas was investigated by the use of reverse transcriptase-PCR.
18976723	Potential use of an estrogen-glucocorticoid receptor chimera as a drug screen for tissue selective estrogenic activity.	SERMs act as ER agonists in bone despite their antagonistic properties in other tissues. As well as inhibiting bone remodelling, this effect may involve stimulation of osteoblast activity, in light of evidence from recent in vivo studies. However, progress in exploring this action has been hampered by a lack of accurate in vitro models. For example, ER antagonists are reported to stimulate reporter assays based on estrogen target genes in osteoblasts, contrary to their inhibitory effects in vivo. We examined whether evaluating global aspects of ER function provides a more accurate reflection of ER activation in osteoblasts, based on the use of morphological and/or transcriptional read-outs with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-receptor chimeras. Osteoblast-like (ROS and U2OS) and breast cancer (MCF7) cells were transfected with a human ERalpha-GFP fusion protein, and treated with ER agonists (17beta-estradiol, and dienestrol), antagonists (ICI 182,780 and ZK 164015) and SERMs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) and hexestrol). We investigated cellular compartmentalisation of these constructs by fluorescence microscopy, nuclear mobility by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and global activation of estrogenic transcription using a ERE-luc reporter. SERMs caused a modest increase in ERE-luc activity in osteoblast-like cells (but not in breast cells), and a reduction in nuclear mobility in breast (but not osteoblast-like) cells. These studies were then repeated using a GFP chimera where the human GR ligand binding domain (LBD) was replaced by the human ERalpha LBD (ERGR-GFP), combined with a GRE-luc reporter. Interestingly, SERMs increased both cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of ERGR-GFP, and GRE-luc reporter activity, in osteoblast-like (but not breast) cells. Indeed, transcriptional responses to SERMs in osteoblast-like cells were considerably greater with the ERGR/GRE-luc than the ERalpha/ERE-luc system, 4-HT inducing 300 and 25% increases in reporter activity respectively. ER antagonists were entirely without effect. We conclude that evaluation of global estrogenic activity, as opposed to activation of a specific target gene, provides a more accurate read-out for osteoblast stimulation. In particular, ERGR-mediated GRE-luc activity provides a high signal response to estrogen agonists and SERMs, in a cell context dependent manner closely resembling that observed in vivo. Further studies utilising this system are justified to explore the mechanistic basis for estrogenic stimulation of osteoblast activity, and to identify newer SERMs capable of targeting this activity.
18991872	Serotonin (5-HT) transporter ligands affect plasma 5-HT in rats.	Dual dopamine (DA)/serotonin (5-HT)-releasing agents are promising candidate medications for stimulant addiction and other disorders. However, certain 5-HT transporter (SERT) substrates are associated with development of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and valvular heart disease (VHD). According to the "5-HT hypothesis," SERT substrates increase the risk for developing IPAH and VHD by increasing plasma 5-HT. To test this hypothesis directly, we determined the effects of acute and chronic fenfluramine, and other SERT ligands, on plasma 5-HT in male rats. For acute treatments, rats received i.v. vehicle or test drug (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), and serial blood samples were withdrawn. For chronic treatments, vehicle or test drug was infused via osmotic minipump (3 and 10 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks. On the last day of infusion, rats received i.v. fenfluramine challenge (1 mg/kg), and serial blood samples were withdrawn. Plasma 5-HT was measured using ex vivo microdialysis in whole-blood samples. Baseline plasma 5-HT was <1.0 nM. Acute injection of fenfluramine or other SERT substrates caused large (up to 24-fold) dose-dependent increases in plasma 5-HT. Chronic fenfluramine at 3 and 10 mg/kg/d produced 1.7- and 3.5-fold increases in baseline plasma 5-HT, while chronic fluoxetine had no effect. Chronic infusions of fenfluramine or fluoxetine diminished the ability of acute fenfluramine to elevate dialysate 5-HT, and both drugs markedly reduced whole-blood 5-HT. Acute fenfluramine increases plasma 5-HT to concentrations that are below the micromolar levels necessary to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. Chronic fenfluramine and fluoxetine have minimal effects on plasma 5-HT, suggesting that the increased risk for IPAH associated with fenfluramine does not depend upon elevations in plasma 5-HT.
19000823	Structural basis for catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of human prostaglandin reductase PTGR2.	PTGR2 catalyzes an NADPH-dependent reduction of the conjugated alpha,beta-unsaturated double bond of 15-keto-PGE(2), a key step in terminal inactivation of prostaglandins and suppression of PPARgamma-mediated adipocyte differentiation. Selective inhibition of PTGR2 may contribute to the improvement of insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects. PTGR2 belongs to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The crystal structures reported here reveal features of the NADPH binding-induced conformational change in a LID motif and a polyproline type II helix which are critical for the reaction. Mutation of Tyr64 and Tyr259 significantly reduces the rate of catalysis but increases the affinity to substrate, confirming the structural observations. Besides targeting cyclooxygenase, indomethacin also inhibits PTGR2 with a binding mode similar to that of 15-keto-PGE(2). The LID motif becomes highly disordered upon the binding of indomethacin, indicating plasticity of the active site. This study has implications for the rational design of inhibitors of PTGR2.
19066855	Evaluating the antipsychotic profile of the preferential PDE10A inhibitor, papaverine.	Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that is deficient in schizophrenia patients. In rats, PPI deficits induced by dopamine (DA) agonists are reversed by antipsychotics. Inhibition of the striatum-rich phosphodiesterase (PDE)10A may represent a novel antipsychotic mechanism. Previous studies were controversial, showing antipsychotic-like profiles in measures of PPI for the preferential PDE10A inhibitor papaverine (PAP) but not the novel PDE10A inhibitor TP-10.
19147680	A selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma modulator, telmisartan, binds to the receptor in a different fashion from thiazolidinediones.	Angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers are widely used for the treatment of hypertension, and one angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker, telmisartan, specifically activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma. We studied the impact of PPARgamma mutants on transcriptional control and interaction with cofactors to elucidate differences in the molecular mechanism between telmisartan and other PPARgamma agonists, thiazolidinediones (TZDs). We created several amino acid substitutions in the ligand binding domain of PPARgamma that, based on molecular modeling, may affect the binding of these agents. In transient expression experiments, wild-type PPARgamma-mediated transcription stimulated by telmisartan was more than one third of that stimulated by TZDs. The activation stimulated by TZDs was impaired, whereas activation stimulated by telmisartan was retained, in the H323Y, S342A, and H449A mutants. In the Y473A mutant, the TZD-induced activation was further impaired and lower than that of telmisartan-induced activation. Coexpression of coactivators enhanced the activation by both telmisartan and TZDs, but activation by telmisartan always exceeded that of TZDs in the Y473A mutant. Based on a mammalian two-hybrid assay, the interaction with corepressors was retained in Y473A. Telmisartan and TZDs, but not 9cis retinoic acid, dissociated corepressors from the wild-type PPARgamma. Telmisartan most effectively dissociated corepressors from Y473A. The interaction with coactivators was enhanced by TZD activation of wild-type PPARgamma and both telmisartan and TZD activation of Y473A. Thus, the Y473A mutant is selectively stimulated by telmisartan but not TZDs, suggesting that telmisartan and TZDs have differential effects on the transcriptional control. In conclusion, these PPARgamma mutants could be powerful tools for developing novel therapeutic agents that retain the metabolic efficacy of PPARgamma activation with fewer adverse effects, such as the increase in body weight associated with TZDs.
19337725	Amisulpride is a potent 5-HT7 antagonist: relevance for antidepressant actions in vivo.	Amisulpride is approved for clinical use in treating schizophrenia in a number of European countries and also for treating dysthymia, a mild form of depression, in Italy. Amisulpride has also been demonstrated to be an antidepressant for patients with major depression in many clinical trials. In part because of the selective D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist properties of amisulpride, it has long been widely assumed that dopaminergic modulation is the proximal event responsible for mediating its antidepressant and antipsychotic properties.
19376361	Effects of allopurinol on ischemia and reperfusion in rabbit livers.	In this work, we evaluated the effects of allopurinol (ALO), an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO), on hepatic lesions caused by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in the rabbit liver. Rabbits were pretreated with ALO (10 mg/kg IV) or saline solution 0.9% before the hepatic I/R procedure. The effects of ALO on hepatic injury were evaluated before and after I/R. A standard, warm hepatic I/R procedure caused profound acute liver injury, as indicated by elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactic dehydrogenase levels, as well as a high apoptotic cell count. All of these changes were reversed by the administration of ALO before the hepatic I/R procedure. In conclusion, ALO exerted protective effects on hepatic I/R lesions. This protective effect of ALO was probably associated with blocking the generation of superoxide anions during the hepatic I/R procedure by inhibiting XO activity.
19417176	Topiramate reduces excitability in the basolateral amygdala by selectively inhibiting GluK1 (GluR5) kainate receptors on interneurons and positively modulating GABAA receptors on principal neurons.	Topiramate [2,3:4,5-bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-beta-D-fructopyranose sulfamate] is a structurally novel antiepileptic drug that has broad efficacy in epilepsy, but the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic activity are not fully understood. We have found that topiramate selectively inhibits GluK1 (GluR5) kainate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic responses in rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neurons and protects against seizures induced by the GluK1 kainate receptor agonist (R,S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (ATPA). Here, we demonstrate that topiramate also modulates inhibitory function in the BLA. Using whole-cell recordings in rat amygdala slices, we found that 0.3 to 10 microM topiramate 1) inhibited ATPA-evoked postsynaptic currents recorded from BLA interneurons; 2) suppressed ATPA-induced enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from BLA pyramidal cells; and 3) blocked ATPA-induced suppression of evoked IPSCs, which is mediated by presynaptic GluK1 kainate receptors present on BLA interneurons. Topiramate (10 microM) had no effect on the AMPA [(R,S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid]-induced enhancement of spontaneous activity of BLA neurons. Thus, although topiramate inhibits GluK1 kainate receptor-mediated enhancement of interneuron firing, it promotes evoked GABA release, leading to a net inhibition of circuit excitability. In addition, we found that topiramate (0.3-10 microM) increased the amplitude of evoked, spontaneous, and miniature IPSCs in BLA pyramidal neurons, indicating an enhancement of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor responses. Taken together with our previous findings, we conclude that topiramate protects against hyperexcitability in the BLA by suppressing the GluK1 kainate receptor-mediated excitation of principal neurons by glutamatergic afferents, blocking the suppression of GABA release from interneurons mediated by presynaptic GluK1 kainate receptors and directly enhancing GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory currents.
19427037	Structure of the Fab fragment of therapeutic antibody Ofatumumab provides insights into the recognition mechanism with CD20.	CD20 is an important drug target for B-cell depletion therapy against certain B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. The success of anti-CD20 antibody drugs such as Rituximab, Ibritumomab, and Tositumomab has promoted the development of new generation of anti-CD20 antibodies for therapeutic applications. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 antibody that is currently in phase III clinical trial for several types of malignancies and autoimmune diseases and is one of the most promising anti-CD20 drugs. Here we report the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of Ofatumumab at 2.2A resolution. The antigen combining site is composed of a large, deep pocket formed by six CDR loops. The pocket has a hydrophobic periphery and a positively charged bottom. Structure analysis and comparison with other antibodies suggest that the hydrophobic periphery might interact with the epitope on CD20 that is enriched with hydrophobic residues and very close to cell membrane, and the positively charged bottom might interact with Glu(150) of CD20 which is the only negatively charged residue within the epitope. These results provide some insights into the recognition of Ofatumumab with CD20 and explain how the antibody can recognize an epitope so close to the cell membrane.
19458386	Pharmacological inhibition of ABCA1 degradation increases HDL biogenesis and exhibits antiatherogenesis.	Expression of ABCA1 is regulated by transcription of the gene and calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation, and inhibition ABCA1 degradation results in increased ABCA1 and HDL biogenesis in vitro. We examined whether this approach could be a potential antiatherogenic treatment. Although probucol inhibits both the activity and degradation of ABCA1, its oxidized products, spiroquinone and diphenoquinone, reduce degradation of ABCA1 without inhibiting its activity or altering transcription of the ABCA1 gene. Accordingly, both compounds enhanced apolipoprotein A-I/ABCA1-dependent generation of HDL in vitro, and increased hepatic ABCA1 and plasma HDL without increasing antioxidant activity in plasma when given to rabbits. Both compounds also decreased vascular lipid deposition in cholesterol-fed rabbits. We therefore conclude that stabilization of ABCA1 against calpain-mediated degradation is a novel and potentially important strategy to increase HDL formation and prevent atherosclerosis. Spiroquinone and diphenoquinone are potential seeds for development of such drugs.
19460945	Rifampicin-activated human pregnane X receptor and CYP3A4 induction enhance acetaminophen-induced toxicity.	Acetaminophen (APAP) is safe at therapeutic levels but causes hepatotoxicity via N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine-induced oxidative stress upon overdose. To determine the effect of human (h) pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation and CYP3A4 induction on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, mice humanized for PXR and CYP3A4 (TgCYP3A4/hPXR) were treated with APAP and rifampicin. Human PXR activation and CYP3A4 induction enhanced APAP-induced hepatotoxicity as revealed by hepatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities elevated in serum, and hepatic necrosis after coadministration of rifampicin and APAP, compared with APAP administration alone. In contrast, hPXR mice, wild-type mice, and Pxr-null mice exhibited significantly lower ALT/AST levels compared with TgCYP3A4/hPXR mice after APAP administration. Toxicity was coincident with depletion of hepatic glutathione and increased production of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting increased oxidative stress upon hPXR activation. Moreover, mRNA analysis demonstrated that CYP3A4 and other PXR target genes were significantly induced by rifampicin treatment. Urinary metabolomic analysis indicated that cysteine-APAP and its metabolite S-(5-acetylamino-2-hydroxyphenyl)mercaptopyruvic acid were the major contributors to the toxic phenotype. Quantification of plasma APAP metabolites indicated that the APAP dimer formed coincident with increased oxidative stress. In addition, serum metabolomics revealed reduction of lysophosphatidylcholine in the APAP-treated groups. These findings demonstrated that human PXR is involved in regulation of APAP-induced toxicity through CYP3A4-mediated hepatic metabolism of APAP in the presence of PXR ligands.
19463689	Coactivator selective regulation of androgen receptor activity.	The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand activated nuclear receptor, which regulates transcription and stimulates growth of androgen dependent prostate cancer. To regulate transcription, AR recruits a series of coactivators that modify chromatin and facilitate transcription. However, information on ligand and target gene-specific requirements for coactivators is limited. We compared the actions of the p160 coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-3/RAC3 with SRA (steroid receptor RNA activator). All three coactivate AR in the presence of agonist as expected. However, overexpression of either SRC-1 or SRC-3 increased AR activity in response to the partial antagonist, cyproterone acetate, whereas SRA was unable to stimulate AR activity under these conditions. Using siRNA to reduce expression of these coactivators in LNCaP cells, we also found promoter specific requirement for these coactivators. SRC-3 is required for optimal androgen dependent induction of PSA, TMPRSS2, and PMEPA1 whereas SRA is required only for optimal induction of the TMPRSS2 gene. These data indicate that different groups of AR target genes have distinct requirements for coactivators and response to AR ligands.
19463840	Rapid and transient stimulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species by melatonin in normal and tumor leukocytes.	Melatonin is a modified tryptophan with potent biological activity, exerted by stimulation of specific plasma membrane (MT1/MT2) receptors, by lower affinity intracellular enzymatic targets (quinone reductase, calmodulin), or through its strong anti-oxidant ability. Scattered studies also report a perplexing pro-oxidant activity, showing that melatonin is able to stimulate production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we show that on U937 human monocytes melatonin promotes intracellular ROS in a fast (<1 min) and transient (up to 5-6 h) way. Melatonin equally elicits its pro-radical effect on a set of normal or tumor leukocytes; intriguingly, ROS production does not lead to oxidative stress, as shown by absence of protein carbonylation, maintenance of free thiols, preservation of viability and regular proliferation rate. ROS production is independent from MT1/MT2 receptor interaction, since a) requires micromolar (as opposed to nanomolar) doses of melatonin; b) is not contrasted by the specific MT1/MT2 antagonist luzindole; c) is not mimicked by a set of MT1/MT2 high affinity melatonin analogues. Instead, chlorpromazine, the calmodulin inhibitor shown to prevent melatonin-calmodulin interaction, also prevents melatonin pro-radical effect, suggesting that the low affinity binding to calmodulin (in the micromolar range) may promote ROS production.
19464167	Regulation of activities of steroid hormone receptors by tibolone and its primary metabolites.	This work was undertaken (i) to study deeply the estrogen, androgen and progestative activities of tibolone and its metabolites (ii) to determine whether tibolone and its metabolites present glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity. For this purpose, we used human cell lines bearing a luciferase gene with a responsive element under the control of human estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) or estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) or androgen receptor (AR) or chimeric Gal4 fusion with progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The major tibolone metabolites, the two hydroxymetabolites, bind and activate ER with a preference for ERalpha. Tibolone and the Delta(4)-tibolone are agonists for AR and PR and surprisingly 3alpha- and 3beta-OH-tibolone are antagonists for them. Moreover we showed for the first time that tibolone and its primary metabolites are GR and MR antagonists with a stronger affinity for MR than for GR. In conclusion, tibolone by these actions on different receptors and by this capacity to transform in different metabolites, has more complex effects than initially supposed.
19465935	Increased expression of the nitric oxide synthase gene and protein in corpus cavernosum by repeated dosing of udenafil in a rat model of chemical diabetogenesis.	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). This study investigates the relationship between ED and the downregulation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) in the corpus cavernosum (CC) of diabetic rats. It also examines the effects of udenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, on ED and cNOS expression levels. After 16 weeks of daily oral treatment with udenafil in diabetic rats, the intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) ratio was recorded to measure erectile function, and cNOS expression was measured using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunoblots. Although the ICP/MAP ratio and the expression levels of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) in the CC were markedly decreased in diabetic rats, long-term udenafil treatment improved the erectile function and increased cNOS expression compared with diabetic controls. These findings suggest that ED in DM is closely related to decreased cNOS expression in the CC and that udenafil has the ability to compensate for this pathological change by modulating cNOS expression. Udenafil also has an inhibitory role in cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) degradation.
19470293	Effects of rivastigmine and donepezil on brain acetylcholine levels in acetylcholinesterase-deficient mice.	Alzheimer s disease is characterized by a dysfunction of central cholinergic systems and is treated by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This study tests the effect of two AChE inhibitors in therapeutic use, rivastigmine and donepezil, in mice that are devoid of AChE (AChE-/- mice). Rivastigmine is an inhibitor of both AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) whereas donepezil is a selective inhibitor of AChE.
19515843	Inhibition of human steroid 5beta-reductase (AKR1D1) by finasteride and structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex.	The Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in nearly all steroid hormones apart from estrogens. The first step in functionalization of the A-ring is mediated in humans by steroid 5alpha- or 5beta-reductase. Finasteride is a mechanism-based inactivator of 5alpha-reductase type 2 with subnanomolar affinity and is widely used as a therapeutic for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also used for androgen deprivation in hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma, and it has been examined as a chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer. The effect of finasteride on steroid 5beta-reductase (AKR1D1) has not been previously reported. We show that finasteride competitively inhibits AKR1D1 with low micromolar affinity but does not act as a mechanism-based inactivator. The structure of the AKR1D1.NADP(+)*finasteride complex determined at 1.7 A resolution shows that it is not possible for NADPH to reduce the Delta(1-2)-ene of finasteride because the cofactor and steroid are not proximal to each other. The C3-ketone of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from the catalytic residues Tyr-58 and Glu-120 in the active site of AKR1D1, providing an explanation for the competitive inhibition observed. This is the first reported structure of finasteride bound to an enzyme involved in steroid hormone metabolism.
19533734	Fustin flavonoid attenuates beta-amyloid (1-42)-induced learning impairment.	Natural flavonoids ameliorate amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. We examined whether the fustin flavonoid affects Abeta-induced learning impairment in mice. Repeated treatment with fustin significantly attenuated Abeta (1-42)-induced conditioned fear and passive avoidance behaviors. This effect was comparable to that of EGb761, a standard extract of ginkgo. Fustin treatment significantly prevented decreases in acetylcholine (ACh) levels, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and ChAT gene expression induced by Abeta (1-42). Fustin also consistently suppressed increases in acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) activity and AChE gene expression induced by Abeta (1-42). In addition, fustin significantly attenuated Abeta (1-42)-induced selective decreases in muscarinic M1 receptor gene expression and muscarinic M1 receptor binding activity (as determined by [(3)H]pirenzepine binding) by modulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. These effects of fustin were reversed by treatment with dicyclomine, a muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, and SL327, a selective ERK inhibitor, but not by chelerythrine, a pan-protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that fustin attenuates Abeta (1-42)-impaired learning, and that the ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway is important for the M1 receptor-mediated cognition-enhancing effects of fustin.
19616061	An allosteric binding site at the human serotonin transporter mediates the inhibition of escitalopram by R-citalopram: kinetic binding studies with the ALI/VFL-SI/TT mutant.	The human serotonin transporter (hSERT) has primary and allosteric binding sites for escitalopram and R-citalopram. Previous studies have established that the interaction of these two compounds at a low affinity allosteric binding site of hSERT can affect the dissociation of [(3)H]escitalopram from hSERT. The allosteric binding site involves a series of residues in the 10th, 11th, and 12th trans-membrane domains of hSERT. The low affinity allosteric activities of escitalopram and R-citalopram are essentially eliminated in a mutant hSERT with changes in some of these residues, namely A505V, L506F, I507L, S574T, I575T, as measured in dissociation binding studies. We confirm that in association binding experiments, R-citalopram at clinically relevant concentrations reduces the association rate of [(3)H]escitalopram as a ligand to wild type hSERT. We demonstrate that the ability of R-citalopram to reduce the association rate of escitalopram is also abolished in the mutant hSERT (A505V, L506F, I507L, S574T, I575T), along with the expected disruption the low affinity allosteric function on dissociation binding. This suggests that the allosteric binding site mediates both the low affinity and higher affinity interactions between R-citalopram, escitalopram, and hSERT. Our data add an additional structural basis for the different efficacies of escitalopram compared to racemic citalopram reported in animal studies and clinical trials, and substantiate the hypothesis that hSERT has complex allosteric mechanisms underlying the unexplained in vivo activities of its inhibitors.
19654053	Effects of allopurinol on uric acid concentrations, xanthine oxidoreductase activity and oxidative stress in broiler chickens.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of allopurinol (AL) on xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity and uric acid (UA) levels in chickens. Thirty 5-week-old broilers were divided into three groups and fed 0 (control), 25 (AL25) or 50 (AL50) mg AL per kg of body mass for 5 weeks. Chicks were weighed twice weekly and leukocyte oxidative activity (LOA) and plasma purine levels were determined weekly in five birds per group. Chicks were sacrificed after 2 or 5 weeks, and samples from tissues were taken for analysis of XOR activity. Plasma UA concentrations were lower (P<0.001) and xanthine and hypoxanthine concentrations were greater (P<0.001) in AL25 and AL50 birds compared to controls, whereas no differences (P=0.904) were detected in allantoin concentrations. By week 5, body mass was reduced (P<0.001) to 84.0 and 65.1% of that in controls for AL25 and AL50 broilers, respectively, and LOA was 4.1 times greater (P<0.05) in AL25 compared to control birds. Liver XOR activity was increased by 1.1 and 1.2 times in AL25 and AL50 birds, but there was no change (P>0.05) in XOR activity in the pancreas and intestine. These results suggest that AL effect on XOR activity is tissue dependent.
1965892	Induction of beta-retinoic acid receptor mRNA by teratogenic doses of retinoids in murine fetuses.	Retinoic acid is required for normal growth and development, however excessive doses are teratogenic. Recently several nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR) have been identified and postulated to mediate the response of retinoic acid at the gene level. We wished to determine if alpha-RAR mRNA or beta-RAR mRNA levels are modulated by teratogenic doses of retinoic acid in vivo. We have found that beta-RAR mRNA levels in 9-day-gestation mouse conceptuses are increased as early as 3 h after administration of a completely teratogenic dose of retinoic acid (100 mg/kg body weight; b.w.) and reach a maximum of approximately sixfold after 6 h of treatment. Maternal liver and maternal kidney demonstrated a similar pattern of increase in beta-RAR mRNA, however this was only approximately threefold. Retinoic acid dose-response experiments demonstrated a reduced increase of beta-RAR mRNA levels with 10 mg/kg b.w. (minimally teratogenic dose), and no increase with a more-physiological dose of 1 mg/kg b.w. in the conceptuses. beta-RAR mRNA levels were elevated in 18-day-gestation fetuses to a similar extent to that observed in the 9-day-gestation conceptuses. Therefore, the twofold difference in the extent to which beta-RAR mRNA levels increase does not occur because the fetuses are at a developmental stage that is sensitive to the teratogenic effects of retinoic acid. Finally, treatment with another teratogenic retinoid, etretinate, and a nonteratogenic retinoid, retinoyl beta-glucuronide, both resulted in increase in the level of beta-RAR mRNA in the conceptuses and the maternal tissues. Therefore, an increase in beta-RAR mRNA levels caused by treatment with retinoids does not necessarily commit a fetus to undergo an abnormal pattern of development characteristic of teratogenic retinoids.
19668749	Brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension: a review of its pharmacology and use in the treatment of open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.	Brinzolamide is a white powder commercially formulated as a 1% ophthalmic suspension to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). Pharmacologically, brinzolamide is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible, and effective inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), able to suppress formation of aqueous humor in the eye and thus to decrease IOP. Several clinical trials have evaluated its safety and the most commonly ocular adverse events are blurred vision (3%-8%), ocular discomfort (1.8%-5.9%), and eye pain (0.7%-4.0%). Brinzolamide has been introduced to treat ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma. In some clinical studies it has been estimated that brinzolamide reduced IOP by was about 18%. Brinzolamide can be added to beta-blockers and prostaglandins. In the latter combination, because prostaglandin derivatives improve the uveoscleral outflow but also increase the activity of CA in ciliary epithelium with a secondary increase in aqueous humor secretion, and slightly reduce the efficacy of prostaglandin analogues, theoretically topical CA inhibitors (CAI) decrease IOP by inhibiting CA-II, thus improving prostaglandin efficacy as well as lowering IOP. Brinzolamide could have a secondary possible effect on ocular flow too. Some clinical studies showed a mild improvement of ocular blood flow. Theoretically, CAI could give rise to metabolic acidosis, with secondary vasodilatation and improvement of blood flow. Systemic acidosis can occur in the setting of oral CAI therapy, and local acidosis within ocular tissues is theoretically possible with topical CAI therapy, with the potential for a local increase in ocular blood flow. In conclusion, topical CAI treatment has efficacy in IOP-lowering ranging from 15% to 20%. From published data, brinzolamide can be used as first-line medication, even if other medications have a higher efficacy, with few side effects and it is a good adjunctive treatment. In some type of glaucoma patients with a vascular dysregulation, topical CAI could have a double effect: reducing IOP and improving ocular blood flow.
19669185	Burkholderia cenocepacia: a new biocatalyst for efficient bioreduction of ezetimibe intermediate.	Ezetimibe is a selective acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor used in hypercholesterolemia. Synthesis of ezetimibe requires enantiopure 3-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-5(S)-hydroxypentanoyl]-4(S)-4-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (FOP alcohol) as a crucial intermediate which is produced by reduction of the corresponding prochiral ketone (FOP dione). A new biocatalyst from acclimatized soil was screened for bioreduction of the above prochiral ketone. The microorganism was identified by 16S mRNA sequencing, as Burkholderia cenocepacia. Various physicochemical conditions were optimized to increase cellmass and enzyme activity. The overall increase in cellmass concentration and enzyme activity was 2.06 and 1.85-fold, respectively. Various reaction conditions, for example pH, temperature, agitation, and cellmass concentration, were optimized for maximum product yield (chiral alcohol) with excellent enantioselectivity. Best reduction was achieved in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) at 40 degrees C (200 rpm) and the yield of enantiopure alcohol from the corresponding prochiral ketone was 54%. This biocatalyst was also used for the reduction of various other prochiral ketones.
19673610	Functional mechanism of neuroprotection by inhibitors of type B monoamine oxidase in Parkinson's disease.	Neuroprotective therapy has been proposed for age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Inhibitors of type B monoamine oxidase (MAOB-Is), rasagiline and (-)deprenyl, are the most promising candidate neuroprotective drugs. Clinical trials of rasagiline in patients with Parkinson's disease suggest that rasagiline may have some disease-modifying effects. Results using animal and cellular models have proved that the MAOB-Is protect neurons by the intervention of 'intrinsic' mitochondrial apoptotic cascade and the induction of prosurvival antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and neurotrophic factors. Rasagiline-related MAOB-Is prevent mitochondrial permeability transition induced by various insults and activation of subsequent apoptotic cascades: cytochrome c release, casapase activation, and condensation and fragmentation of nuclear DNA. MAOB-Is increase transcription of prosurvival genes through activating the nuclear transcription factor-(NF) system. Rasagiline increases the protein and mRNA levels of GDNF in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells, whereas (-)deprenyl increases those of BDNF. Systemic administration of (-)deprenyl and rasagiline increases these neurotrophic factors in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease and nonhuman primates. This review presents recent advances in our understanding of the neuroprotection offered by MAOB-Is and possible evaluation of neuroprotective efficacy in clinical samples is discussed.
19730427	Epinephrine, phenylephrine, and methoxamine induce infiltrative anesthesia via alpha1-adrenoceptors in rats.	To assess whether epinephrine, phenylephrine, and methoxamine act via certain subtypes of adrenoceptors to exert their local anesthetic activity.
19744340	Glucocorticoids with different chemical structures but similar glucocorticoid receptor potency regulate subsets of common and unique genes in human trabecular meshwork cells.	In addition to their well-documented ocular therapeutic effects, glucocorticoids (GCs) can cause sight-threatening side-effects including ocular hypertension presumably via morphological and biochemical changes in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. In the present study, we directly compared the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) potency for dexamethasone (DEX), fluocinolone acetonide (FA) and triamcinolone acetonide (TA), examined the expression of known GRalpha and GRbeta isoforms, and used gene expression microarrays to compare the effects of DEX, FA, and TA on the complete transcriptome in two primary human TM cell lines.
19774211	Role of everolimus in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.	The therapeutic options in metastatic renal cell carcinoma have been recently expanded by the discovery of the VHL gene, the mutation of which is associated with development of clear cell carcinoma, and overexpression of the angiogenesis pathway, resulting in a very vascular tumor. This breakthrough in science led to the development of a variety of small molecules inhibiting the VEGF-dependent angiogenic pathway, such as sunitinib and sorafenib. These agents prolong overall and progression-free survival, respectively. The result was the development of robust front-line therapies which ultimately fail and are associated with disease progression. In this setting, there existed an unmet need for developing second-line therapies for patients with refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC). Everolimus (RAD 001) is an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of everolimus (RECORD-1) conducted in MRCC patients after progression on sunitinib or sorafenib, or both, demonstrated a progression-free survival benefit favoring the study drug (4.9 months vs 1.9 months, HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.43, P </= 0 0.001). Everolimus thus established itself as a standard of care in the second-line setting for patients with MRCC who have failed treatment with VEGF receptor inhibitors.
19796047	Melatonin-induced estrogen receptor alpha-mediated calbindin-D9k expression plays a role in H2O2-mediated cell death in rat pituitary GH3 cells.	Calbindin-D9k (CaBP-9k) is a 9-kDa polypeptide possessing two calcium-binding sites that is expressed in the mammalian intestine, uterus, and pituitary gland. The factors regulating the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and CaBP-9k in the pituitary gland are currently unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the ER and CaBP-9k expression are regulated by melatonin during H(2)O(2)-induced cell death in rat pituitary GH3 cells. Cell survival increased by approximately 27-36% in H(2)O(2) plus melatonin compared to H(2)O(2) alone, and CaBP-9k expression was augmented by treatment with H(2)O(2) plus melatonin. These results suggest that the increase in cell survival and the melatonin-induced CaBP-9k expression may play a role in protecting cells against H(2)O(2)-mediated cell death. This result is also consistent with the increase in CaBP-9k expression leading to rises in p-ERK and p-Bad (S112). Over-expression of CaBP-9k caused an increase in p-ERK. ERalpha expression was higher in H(2)O(2) plus melatonin-treated cells compared to those treated with H(2)O(2) alone, while ERbeta expression was not. Also, ERalpha in the nuclear fraction increased in the presence of melatonin and decreased in the presence of ICI 182 780 or ICI 182 780 plus melatonin. The relative binding affinity of ERalpha for melatonin was higher than that of ERbeta, suggesting that melatonin has the potential to preferentially bind ERalpha. In conclusion, these results indicate that melatonin may increase CaBP-9k expression through ERalpha.
19808995	Crofelemer, an antisecretory antidiarrheal proanthocyanidin oligomer extracted from Croton lechleri, targets two distinct intestinal chloride channels.	Crofelemer, a purified proanthocyanidin oligomer extracted from the bark latex of Croton lechleri, is in clinical trials for secretory diarrheas of various etiologies. We investigated the antisecretory mechanism of crofelemer by determining its effect on the major apical membrane transport and signaling processes involved in intestinal fluid transport. Using cell lines and measurement procedures to isolate the effects on individual membrane transport proteins, crofelemer at 50 microM had little or no effect on the activity of epithelial Na(+) or K(+) channels or on cAMP or calcium signaling. Crofelemer inhibited the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel with maximum inhibition of approximately 60% and an IC(50) approximately 7 microM. Crofelemer action at an extracellular site on CFTR produced voltage-independent block with stabilization of the channel closed state. Crofelemer did not affect the potency of glycine hydrazide or thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitors. Crofelemer action resisted washout, with <50% reversal of CFTR inhibition after 4 h. Crofelemer was also found to strongly inhibit the intestinal calcium-activated Cl(-) channel TMEM16A by a voltage-independent inhibition mechanism with maximum inhibition >90% and IC(50) approximately 6.5 microM. The dual inhibitory action of crofelemer on two structurally unrelated prosecretory intestinal Cl(-) channels may account for its intestinal antisecretory activity.
19820031	Impact of growth hormone receptor blockade on substrate metabolism during fasting in healthy subjects.	Experimental studies in GH-deficient patients and in healthy subjects receiving somatostatin-infusion suggest that GH is an important regulator of substrate metabolism during fasting. These models may not adequately reflect the selective effects of GH, and GH receptor (GHR) blockade offers a new model to define the metabolic role of GH.
19822896	Nilotinib for the frontline treatment of Ph(+) chronic myeloid leukemia.	Nilotinib has a higher binding affinity and selectivity for BCR-ABL with respect to imatinib and is an effective treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after imatinib failure. In a phase 2 study, 73 early chronic-phase, untreated, Ph(+) CML patients, received nilotinib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) rate at 1 year. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the CCgR rate at 1 year was 96%, and the major molecular response rate 85%. Responses were rapid, with 78% CCgR and 52% major molecular response at 3 months. During the first year, the treatment was interrupted at least once in 38 patients (52%). The mean daily dose ranged between 600 and 800 mg in 74% of patients, 400 and 599 mg in 18% of patients, and was less than 400 mg in 8% of patients. Dose interruptions were mainly due to nonhematologic and biochemical side effects. Myelosuppression was irrelevant. One patient progressed to blastic crisis after 6 months; one went off-treatment for lipase increase grade 4 (no pancreatitis). Nilotinib is safe and very active in early chronic-phase CML. These data support a role for nilotinib for the frontline treatment of CML. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00481052.
19828880	Direct agonist activity of tricyclic antidepressants at distinct opioid receptor subtypes.	Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been reported to interact with the opioid system, but their pharmacological activity at opioid receptors has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the actions of amoxapine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine at distinct cloned and native opioid receptors. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing delta-opioid receptors (CHO/DOR), TCAs displaced [3H]naltrindole binding and stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding at micromolar concentrations with amoxapine displaying the highest potency and efficacy. Amoxapine and amitriptyline inhibited cyclic AMP formation and induced the phosphorylation of signaling molecules along the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways. Amoxapine also activated delta-opioid receptors in rat dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens and human frontal cortex. In CHO cells expressing kappa-opioid receptors (CHO/KOR), TCAs, but not amoxapine, exhibited higher receptor affinity and more potent stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding than in CHO/DOR and effectively inhibited cyclic AMP accumulation. Amitriptyline regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activity in CHO/KOR and C6 glioma cells endogenously expressing kappa-opioid receptors, and this effect was attenuated by the kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. In rat nucleus accumbens, amitriptyline slightly inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity and counteracted the inhibitory effect of the full kappa agonist trans-(-)-3,4dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (U50,488). At the cloned mu-opioid receptor, TCAs showed low affinity and no significant agonist activity. These results show that TCAs differentially regulate opioid receptors with a preferential agonist activity on either delta or kappa subtypes and suggest that this property may contribute to their therapeutic and/or side effects.
19833195	Assessment of a recombinant androgen receptor binding assay: initial steps towards validation.	Despite more than a decade of research in the field of endocrine active compounds with affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), still no validated recombinant AR binding assay is available, although recombinant AR can be obtained from several sources. With funding from the European Union (EU)-sponsored 6th framework project, ReProTect, we developed a model protocol for such an assay based on a simple AR binding assay recently developed at our institution. Important features of the protocol were the use of a rat recombinant fusion protein to thioredoxin containing both the hinge region and ligand binding domain (LBD) of the rat AR (which is identical to the human AR-LBD) and performance in a 96-well plate format. Besides two reference compounds [dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione] ten test compounds with different affinities for the AR [levonorgestrel, progesterone, prochloraz, 17alpha-methyltestosterone, flutamide, norethynodrel, o,p'-DDT, dibutylphthalate, vinclozolin, linuron] were used to explore the performance of the assay. At least three independent experiments per compound were performed. The AR binding properties of reference and test compounds were well detected, in terms of the relative ranking of binding affinities, there was good agreement with published data obtained from experiments using recombinant AR preparations. Irrespective of the chemical nature of the compound, individual IC(50)-values for a given compound varied by not more than a factor of 2.6. Our data demonstrate that the assay reliably ranked compounds with strong, weak, and no/marginal affinity for the AR with high accuracy. It avoids the manipulation and use of animals, as a recombinant protein is used and thus contributes to the 3R concept. On the whole, this assay is a promising candidate for further validation.
19886911	Molecular mechanism underlying the synergistic interaction between trifluorothymidine and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib in human colorectal cancer cell lines.	The pyrimidine trifluorothymidine (TFT) inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) and can be incorporated into the DNA. TFT, as part of TAS-102, is clinically evaluated in phase II studies as an oral chemotherapeutic agent. Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is often deregulated in colorectal cancer. This study investigated molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic actions of the combination of an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor with TFT in colorectal cancer cells Caco2, WiDR, Lovo92, and Colo320. Drug interactions were examined by the sulforhodamine B assay and subsequent combination index (CI) analyses, cell cycle effects by FACS analysis of propidium iodide stained cells, Akt, MAPK and EGFR phosphorylation and expression levels by Western blotting and TS activity by the TS in situ assay. All combination schedules were synergistic in wt-EGFR expressing (but with mutated downstream pathways) WiDR and Lovo92 (CI 0.4-0.8) and very synergistic in Caco2 cells (with wt-EGFR and functional downstream pathways; CI 0.1-0.3), but in EGFR-lacking Colo320 cells, no additional activity was found (CI 1.0-1.2). Synergism was mostly related to the induction of cell cycle arrest and an erlotinib-mediated inhibition of the pro-survival signaling through Akt and MAPK that was activated (phosphorylated) by TFT. Erlotinib inhibited TS activity in EGFR-expressing cell lines, probably due to cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase. TS activity was slightly lower in the combinations, probably due to cell cycle interference. Taken together, the combination of erlotinib with TFT seems to present a potential strategy in the field of molecular therapeutics.
19920925	Nilotinib: optimal therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and resistance or intolerance to imatinib.	Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the consequence of a single balanced translocation that produces the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene which is detectable in over 90% of patients at presentation. The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) has improved survival in all phases of CML and is the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase. Despite the very significant therapeutic benefits of IM, a small minority of patients with early stage disease do not benefit optimally while IM therapy in patients with advanced disease is of modest benefit in many. Diverse mechanisms may be responsible for IM failures, with point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain being amongst the most common resistance mechanisms described in patients with advanced CML. The development of novel agents designed to overcome IM resistance, while still primarily targeted on BCR-ABL, led to the creation of the high affinity aminopyrimidine inhibitor, nilotinib. Nilotinib is much more potent as a BCR-ABL inhibitor than IM and inhibits both wild type and IM-resistant BCR-ABL with significant clinical activity across the entire spectrum of BCR-ABL mutants with the exception of T315I. The selection of a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor to rescue patients with imatinib failure will be based on several factors including age, co-morbid medical problems and ABL kinase mutational profile. It should be noted that while the use of targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in CML represents a paradigm shift in CML management these agents are not likely to have activity against the quiescent CML stem cell pool. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pre-clinical and clinical data on nilotinib in patients with CML who have failed prior therapy with IM or dasatinib.
1994002	Antagonist binding profiles of five cloned human muscarinic receptor subtypes.	A variety of muscarinic antagonists are currently used as tools to pharmacologically subclassify muscarinic receptors into M1, M2 and M3 subtypes. In the present study, we have determined the affinity profiles of several of these antagonists at five cloned human muscarinic receptors (m1-m5) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). At all five receptors, the (R)-enantiomers of trihexyphenidyl and hexbutinol displayed considerably higher affinities (up to 525-fold) than their corresponding (S)-isomers. The stereoselectivity ratios [inhibition constant(S)/inhibition constant(R)] for both pairs of enantiomers were lowest at m2 receptors, suggesting that less stringent configurational demands are made by this receptor subtype. The "M1-selective" antagonist (R)-trihexyphenidyl displayed high affinities for m1 and m4 receptors. The "M2-selective" antagonists himbacine, (+-)-5,11-dihydro-11- ([(2-[(dipropylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl)ethyl)amino]carbonyl)-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6- one (AF-DX 384), 11-[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b) (1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one (AQ-RA 741) and (+)-(11-[2-[(diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11-di-hydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4) benzodiazepine-6-one [AF-DX 250; the (+)-enantiomer of AF-DX 116] exhibited high affinities for m2 and m4, intermediate affinities for m1 and m3 and low affinities for m5 receptors. This selectivity profile was most prominent for AQ-RA 741, which displayed 195- and 129-fold higher affinities for m2 and m4 receptors than for m5 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
19966183	MT1 melatonin receptors mediate somatic, behavioral, and reproductive neuroendocrine responses to photoperiod and melatonin in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus).	Environmental day length drives nocturnal pineal melatonin secretion, which in turn generates or entrains seasonal cycles of physiology, reproduction, and behavior. In mammals, melatonin (MEL) binds to a number of receptor subtypes including high-affinity (MT1 and MT2) and low-affinity (MT3, nuclear orphan receptors) binding sites, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system and periphery. The MEL receptors that mediate photoperiodic reproductive and behavioral responses to MEL have not been identified in a reproductively photoperiodic species. Here I tested the hypothesis that MT1 receptors are necessary and sufficient to engage photoperiodic responses by challenging male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), a species that does not express functional MT2 receptors, with ramelteon (RAM), a specific MT1/MT2 receptor agonist. In hamsters housed in a long-day photoperiod, late-afternoon RAM treatment inhibited gonadotropin secretion, induced gonadal regression, and suppressed food intake and body mass, mimicking effects of MEL. In addition, chronic (24 h/d) RAM infusions were sufficient to obscure endogenous MEL signaling, and these treatments attenuated gonadal regression in short days. Together, the outcomes indicate that signaling at the MT1 receptor is sufficient and necessary to mediate the effects of photoperiod-driven changes in MEL on behavior and reproductive function in a reproductively photoperiodic mammal.
20007701	Directed evolution reveals hidden properties of VMAT, a neurotransmitter transporter.	The vesicular neurotransmitter transporter VMAT2 is responsible for the transport of monoamines into synaptic and storage vesicles. VMAT2 is the target of many psychoactive drugs and is essential for proper neurotransmission and survival. Here we describe a new expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that takes advantage of the polyspecificity of VMAT2. Expression of rVMAT2 confers resistance to acriflavine and to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) by their removal into the yeast vacuole. This expression system allowed identification of a new substrate, acriflavine, and isolation of mutants with modified affinity to tetrabenazine (TBZ), a non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT2 that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and Huntington chorea. Whereas one type of mutant obtained displayed decreased affinity to TBZ, a second type showed only a slight decrease in the affinity to TBZ, displayed a higher K(m) to the neurotransmitter serotonin, but conferred increased resistance to acriflavine and MPP(+). A protein where both types of mutations were combined (with only three amino acid replacements) lost most of the properties of the neurotransmitter transporter (TBZ-insensitive, no transport of neurotransmitter) but displayed enhanced resistance to the above toxicants. The work described here shows that in the case of rVMAT2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of function (such as serotonin transport and TBZ binding) bring about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to toxic compounds. A process that has taken millions of years of evolution can be reversed by three mutations.
20014331	Study of a lipophilic captopril analogue binding to angiotensin I converting enzyme.	Human ACE is a central component of the renin-angiotensin system and a major therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. The somatic form of the enzyme (sACE) comprises two homologous metallopeptidase domains (N and C), each bearing a zinc active site with similar but distinct substrate and inhibitor specificities. In this study, we present the biological activity of silacaptopril, a silylated analogue of captopril, and its binding affinity towards ACE. Based on the recently determined crystal structures of both the ACE domains, a series of docking calculations were carried out in order to study the structural characteristics and the binding properties of silacaptopril and its analogues with ACE.
20137114	[Correlation of deoxycytidine kinase gene expression with fludarabine resistance in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia].	The study was purposed to explore the relationship between the expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) gene and fludarabine (Flud) resistance in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) technique was used to detect the mRNA expression of dCK gene in the bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 CLL patients, the difference of dCK expression levels between CLL patients sensitive to Flud and patients resistant to Flud was analyzed. The results showed that dCK expression level in the Flud-sensitive patients was much higher than that in the Flud-resistant ones (p = 0.001); dCK expression level had no relationship with sex, age, Binet stage, IgVH mutations, CD38, ZAP-70 or p53 gene mutation (p > 0.05). It is concluded that low expression or deficiency of dCK in patients may contribute to resistance against Flud- and the prognostic significance of dCK expression remains to be further studied.
20141432	The antidepressants maprotiline and fluoxetine have potent selective antiproliferative effects against Burkitt lymphoma independently of the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters.	The discovery that some selective serotonin transporter- (SSRI) and norepinephrine transporter- (NSRI) targeting antidepressants have the potential to act as anticancer agents adds greatly to their diverse pharmacological application. We report that the SSRI fluoxetine and the NSRI maprotiline are potent antiproliferative agents against human Burkitt lymphoma (BL), having little effect on normal blood cells. The results of this study show that although there is low-level expression of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in some BL cells, NET is not involved in fluoxetine- or maprotiline-mediated cell death, as neither norepinephrine nor other NET inhibitors prevented this death. Of other NET ligands investigated for activity, only desipramine was found to have a similar effect to maprotiline and fluoxetine, suggesting the existence of a common selective structural modality for cell death and aiding in the future development of more potent analogs. In this study, we also show evidence to support previous reports that the serotonin transporter (SERT) has no involvement in antidepressant-mediated cell death, as SERT-specific ligands were unable to prevent fluoxetine or maprotiline cell death and not all SERT ligands could induce cell death. Although no target has yet been identified for the action of these compounds, the cell death elicited is potent, selective, and worthy of future investigation.
20149798	Structural basis of human CYP51 inhibition by antifungal azoles.	The obligatory step in sterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes is demethylation of sterol precursors at the C14-position, which is catalyzed by CYP51 (sterol 14-alpha demethylase) in three sequential reactions. In mammals, the final product of the pathway is cholesterol, while important intermediates, meiosis-activating sterols, are produced by CYP51. Three crystal structures of human CYP51, ligand-free and complexed with antifungal drugs ketoconazole and econazole, were determined, allowing analysis of the molecular basis for functional conservation within the CYP51 family. Azole binding occurs mostly through hydrophobic interactions with conservative residues of the active site. The substantial conformational changes in the B' helix and F-G loop regions are induced upon ligand binding, consistent with the membrane nature of the protein and its substrate. The access channel is typical for mammalian sterol-metabolizing P450 enzymes, but is different from that observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis CYP51. Comparison of the azole-bound structures provides insight into the relative binding affinities of human and bacterial P450 enzymes to ketoconazole and fluconazole, which can be useful for the rational design of antifungal compounds and specific modulators of human CYP51.
20197484	A phase I pharmacologic study of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR in patients with advanced solid malignancies.	This study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for disease-directed studies of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, preliminary antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of necitumumab.
20400469	Role of alpha5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in pharmacological and behavioral effects of nicotine in mice.	Incorporation of the alpha5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit can greatly influence nAChR function without altering receptor number. Although few animal studies have assessed the role of the alpha5 nAChR in nicotine-mediated behaviors, recent evidence suggests an association between polymorphisms in the alpha5 nAChR gene and nicotine dependence phenotypes in humans. Thus, additional studies are imperative to elucidate the role and function of the alpha5 nAChR subunit in nicotine dependence. Using alpha5(-/-) mice, the current study aimed to examine the role of alpha5 nAChRs in the initial pharmacological effects of nicotine, nicotine reward using the conditioned place preference model, and the discriminative effects of nicotine using a two-lever drug discrimination model. (86)Rb(+) efflux and (125)I-epibatidine binding assays were conducted to examine the effect of alpha5 nAChR subunit deletion on expression and activity of functional nAChRs. Results show that alpha5(-/-) mice are less sensitive to the initial effects of nicotine in antinociception, locomotor activity, and hypothermia measures and that the alpha5 nAChR is involved in nicotine reward. Alternatively, alpha5(-/-) mice did not differ from wild-type littermates in sensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine. Furthermore, deletion of the alpha5 nAChR subunit resulted in a statistically significant decrease in function in the thalamus and hindbrain, but the decreases noted in spinal cord were not statistically significant. Receptor number was unaltered in all areas tested. Taken together, results of the study suggest that alpha5 nAChRs are involved in nicotine-mediated behaviors relevant to development of nicotine dependence.
20439738	Identification of select glucocorticoids as Smoothened agonists: potential utility for regenerative medicine.	Regenerative medicine holds the promise of replacing damaged tissues largely by stem cell activation. Hedgehog signaling through the plasma membrane receptor Smoothened (Smo) is an important process for regulating stem cell proliferation. The development of Hedgehog-related therapies has been impeded by a lack of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Smo agonists. Using a high-content screen with cells expressing Smo receptors and a beta-arrestin2-GFP reporter, we identified four FDA-approved drugs, halcinonide, fluticasone, clobetasol, and fluocinonide, as Smo agonists that activate Hedgehog signaling. These drugs demonstrated an ability to bind Smo, promote Smo internalization, activate Gli, and stimulate the proliferation of primary neuronal precursor cells alone and synergistically in the presence of Sonic Hedgehog protein. Halcinonide, fluticasone, clobetasol, and fluocinonide provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop unique clinical strategies to treat Hedgehog-dependent illnesses.
20463020	Structural basis of fatty acid substrate binding to cyclooxygenase-2.	The cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that generate prostaglandin H(2) from arachidonic acid (AA). Although AA is the preferred substrate, other fatty acids are oxygenated by these enzymes with varying efficiencies. We determined the crystal structures of AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) bound to Co(3+)-protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted murine COX-2 to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.65 A, respectively. AA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid bind in different conformations in each monomer constituting the homodimer in their respective structures such that one monomer exhibits nonproductive binding and the other productive binding of the substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel. The interactions identified between protein and substrate when bound to COX-1 are conserved in our COX-2 structures, with the only notable difference being the lack of interaction of the carboxylate of AA and EPA with the side chain of Arg-120. Leu-531 exhibits a different side chain conformation when the nonproductive and productive binding modes of AA are compared. Unlike COX-1, mutating this residue to Ala, Phe, Pro, or Thr did not result in a significant loss of activity or substrate binding affinity. Determination of the L531F:AA crystal structure resulted in AA binding in the same global conformation in each monomer. We speculate that the mobility of the Leu-531 side chain increases the volume available at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel and contributes to the observed ability of COX-2 to oxygenate a broad spectrum of fatty acid and fatty ester substrates.
20502133	Replacing a dopamine agonist by the COMT-inhibitor tolcapone as an adjunct to L-dopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: a randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study.	This study investigated the feasibility, safety, and potential benefit in motor symptom control when switching from a dopamine agonist to tolcapone as an adjunctive therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease with a fluctuating response to levodopa (l-dopa). We determined the efficacy of 2 replacement strategies.
20512624	A possible role of the non-GAT1 GABA transporters in transfer of GABA from GABAergic to glutamatergic neurons in mouse cerebellar neuronal cultures.	Cultures of dissociated cerebellum from 7-day-old mice were used to investigate the mechanism involved in synthesis and cellular redistribution of GABA in these cultures consisting primarily of glutamatergic granule neurons and a smaller population of GABAergic Golgi and stellate neurons. The distribution of GAD, GABA and the vesicular glutamate transporter VGlut-1 was assessed using specific antibodies combined with immunofluorescence microscopy. Additionally, tiagabine, SKF 89976-A, betaine, beta-alanine, nipecotic acid and guvacine were used to inhibit the GAT1, betaine/GABA (BGT1), GAT2 and GAT3 transporters. Only a small population of cells were immuno-stained for GAD while many cells exhibited VGlut-1 like immuno-reactivity which, however, never co-localized with GAD positive neurons. This likely reflects the small number of GABAergic neurons compared to the glutamatergic granule neurons constituting the majority of the cells. GABA uptake exhibited the kinetics of high affinity transport and could be partly (20%) inhibited by betaine (IC(50) 142 microM), beta-alanine (30%) and almost fully (90%) inhibited by SKF 89976-A (IC(50) 0.8 microM) or nipecotic acid and guvacine at 1 mM concentrations (95%). Essentially all neurons showed GABA like immunostaining albeit with differences in intensity. The results indicate that GABA which is synthesized in a small population of GAD-positive neurons is redistributed to essentially all neurons including the glutamatergic granule cells. GAT1 is not likely involved in this redistribution since addition of 15 microM tiagabine (GAT1 inhibitor) to the culture medium had no effect on the overall GABA content of the cells. Likewise the BGT1 transporter cannot alone account for the redistribution since inclusion of 3 mM betaine in the culture medium had no effect on the overall GABA content. The inhibitory action of beta-alanine and high concentrations of nipecotic acid and guvacine on GABA transport strongly suggests that also GAT2 or GAT3 (HUGO nomenclature) could play a role.
20522800	Dominant negative actions of human prostacyclin receptor variant through dimerization: implications for cardiovascular disease.	Prostacyclin and thromboxane mediate opposing cardiovascular effects through their receptors, the prostacyclin receptor (IP) and thromboxane receptor (TP). Individuals heterozygous for an IP variant, IP(R212C), displayed exaggerated loss of platelet IP responsiveness and accelerated cardiovascular disease. We examined association of IP(R212C) into homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes and the impact on prostacyclin and thromboxane biology.
20522977	Donepezil, a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.	Although donepezil, a potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its neuroprotective effects, its mode of action to inhibit the growth of cancer cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic activities of donepezil in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and the underlying molecular mechanism involved. It was found that donepezil induced the apoptosis of HL-60 and U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by the formation of DNA fragmentation and the accumulation of positive cells for Annexin V. In addition, the activations of caspase-8, -9, and -3 were significantly increased 36 h after donepezil treatment. Furthermore, the broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) blocked donepezil-induced apoptosis. In addition, donepezil was found to cause the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), to increase the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and to alter the expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that donepezil displayed an induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells via a mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathway.
20627999	Therapeutic role of rifaximin in inflammatory bowel disease: clinical implication of human pregnane X receptor activation.	Human pregnane X receptor (PXR) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Rifaximin, a human PXR activator, is in clinical trials for treatment of IBD and has demonstrated efficacy in Crohn's disease and active ulcerative colitis. In the current study, the protective and therapeutic role of rifaximin in IBD and its respective mechanism were investigated. PXR-humanized (hPXR), wild-type, and Pxr-null mice were treated with rifaximin in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD models to determine the protective function of human PXR activation in IBD. The therapeutic role of rifaximin was further evaluated in DSS-treated hPXR and Pxr-null mice. Results demonstrated that preadministration of rifaximin ameliorated the clinical hallmarks of colitis in DSS- and TNBS-treated hPXR mice as determined by body weight loss and assessment of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon length, and histology. In addition, higher survival rates and recovery from colitis symptoms were observed in hPXR mice, but not in Pxr-null mice, when rifaximin was administered after the onset of symptoms. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target genes were markedly down-regulated in hPXR mice by rifaximin treatment. In vitro NF-κB reporter assays demonstrated inhibition of NF-κB activity after rifaximin treatment in colon-derived cell lines expressing hPXR. These findings demonstrated the preventive and therapeutic role of rifaximin on IBD through human PXR-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB signaling cascade, thus suggesting that human PXR may be an effective target for the treatment of IBD.
20637823	Effect of prenatal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonism on postnatal development.	Recent work indicates that PPARalpha is required for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)-induced postnatal lethality resulting from prenatal exposure. The present study tested the hypothesis that relatively modest activation of PPARalpha during prenatal development will cause postnatal lethality, similar to that observed with PFOA, a relatively low affinity PPARalpha agonist. Female wild-type and Pparalpha-null mice were mated overnight with males of the same genotype. The presence of a copulatory plug on the morning after mating was indicative of pregnancy and considered gestation day (GD) 0. Plugged female mice were fed either a control diet or one containing clofibrate (0.5%) or Wy-14,643 (0.005%) until GD18 or until parturition. Mice were examined on GD18 or on postnatal day (PND) 20 following the prenatal exposure period. Dietary administration of clofibrate or Wy-14,643 did not affect maternal weight or weight gain, the average number of implantations, the percentage of litter loss, the average number of live/dead fetuses, average crown-rump length, or the average fetal weight on GD18 in either genotype. An increase in relative maternal liver weight and elevated expression of PPARalpha target genes in maternal and fetal livers on GD18 were observed, indicative of PPARalpha-dependent changes in both the maternal and fetal compartments. However, no defects in postnatal development were observed by either clofibrate or Wy-14,643 in either genotype by PND20. These results demonstrate that relatively low level activation of PPARalpha by clofibrate or Wy-14,643 during prenatal development does not cause postnatal lethality.
20645691	Efficacy of abiraterone acetate in post-docetaxel castration-resistant prostate cancer.	Evaluation of: Reid AH, Attard G, Danila DC et al. Significant and sustained antitumor activity in post-docetaxel, castration-resistant prostate cancer with the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone acetate. J. Clin. Oncol. 28(9), 1489-1495 (2010). Inhibition of cytochrome P17 (CYP17), which is involved in androgen synthesis, is a promising therapeutic strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The first multicenter, Phase II study of a CYP17 inhibitor, the small molecule abiraterone acetate, has been conducted on 47 patients that received prior docetaxel chemotherapy for prostate cancer. With 1000 mg once daily, declines of more than 50% in prostate-specific antigen and circulating tumor cell counts were seen in 51 and 63% of patients, respectively. Overall, the drug was well tolerated and had a significant antitumor activity with symptomatic improvements. Reid and colleagues' study highlights abiraterone as a key molecule in CRPC treatment and gives further evidence of the involvement of the androgen receptor signaling axis in the disease. A randomized Phase III trial is ongoing to define the prognostic impact of this drug among the very limited arsenal of drugs currently available for CRPC. In the meantime, other CYP17 inhibitors are expected to show a favorable safety and efficacy profile, as are other novel powerful agents and combinatorial therapeutic strategies.
20653327	Therapeutic potential of aleglitazar, a new dual PPAR-α/γ agonist: implications for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus.	Preventing morbidity and mortality from diabetes mellitus is of paramount importance as the incidence of this disease is increasing across the world. While microvascular complications of diabetes such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy are reduced with intensive glycemic control, treatment of hyperglycemia has not been consistently shown to have effects on the macrovascular complications of diabetes such as coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. Preventive efforts have accordingly shifted toward the modification of other cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. Agonism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) has long been an attractive target for antidiabetic therapy due to the role of PPARs in glycemic control and lipid metabolism. PPAR-α agonists such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are used in clinical practice for the treatment of diabetes, and there is some evidence that pioglitazone may have positive effects on cardiovascular complications by virtue of its favorable effects on lipid profiles. However, they have not been shown to reduce macrovascular events. PPAR-α agonism is the mechanism of action in the fibrate class of medications; these agents have been shown to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, reduce triglyceride levels, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Given the prevalence of lipid abnormalities in patients with diabetes, dual PPAR-α/γ agonists (glitazars) could potentially benefit patients with diabetes. A phase II trial examining a novel dual PPAR agonist, aleglitazar, showed that therapy with this agent reduced hyperglycemia and favorably modified levels of HDL-C and triglycerides with an acceptable safety profile. Aleglitazar is currently being studied in large-scale clinical trials to assess whether it will reduce the risk of major cardiovascular endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) among patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease. If ongoing studies confirm the theoretical benefit and safety of dual PPAR-α/γ agonism, aleglitazar may become the first therapy demonstrated to reduce macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes.
20658522	Lapatinib, a dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, augments basal cleavage of HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) to inhibit HER2-driven cancer cell growth.	The ultimate biological and clinical meaning of shed HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) has remained largely unclear until recently. Oversecretion of soluble HER2 ECD has been shown to inhibit growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells by promoting HER2 ECD dimerization with HER transmembrane receptors thus impairing their cross-tyrosine phosphorylation and decreasing their activation status. HER2-targeted drugs capable to enhance the occurrence of basal HER2 ECD shedding but simultaneously preventing formation of truncated cell membrane-bound HER2 intracellular fragment, which exhibits an undesirable constitutive kinase activity, might be extremely efficient at managing HER2-positive cancer disease. The dual HER1/HER2 Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor lapatinib, which works intracellularly and directly targets the TK domain of HER2, drastically augments basal shedding of HER2 ECD to inhibit HER2-driven cancer cell growth. Lapatinib treatment significantly augments the concentration of the inactive (unphosphorylated) form of HER2 protein at the tumor cell membrane and promotes an exacerbated HER2 ECD shedding to the extracellular milieu of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. Exacerbated sensitivity of trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells, which contain nearly undetectable levels of soluble HER2 ECD when compared with trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to lapatinib-induced cell growth inhibition, takes place when lapatinib treatment fully restores high levels of basal HER2 ECD shedding. The dramatic augmentation of HER2 ECD shedding that occurs upon treatment of with lapatinib is fully suppressed in lapatinib-refractory HER2-positive cells. These findings, altogether, may provide crucial insights concerning clinical studies aimed to accurately describe HER2 ECD as a potential predictor of response or resistance to the HER2-targeted drugs trastuzumab and lapatinib.
20682597	Different effects of enoxaparin, nadroparin, and dalteparin on plasma TFPI during hemodialysis: a prospective crossover randomized study.	Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are an alternative to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for anticoagulation during hemodialysis (HD). We performed a prospective randomized crossover study of the effect of enoxaparin, nadroparin, and dalteparin on some hemostatic factors, including tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), in patients with maintenance HD.
20732414	Nuclear β-adrenergic receptors modulate gene expression in adult rat heart.	Both β(1)- and β(3)-adrenergic receptors (β(1)ARs and β(3)ARs) are present on nuclear membranes in adult ventricular myocytes. These nuclear-localized receptors are functional with respect to ligand binding and effector activation. In isolated cardiac nuclei, the non-selective βAR agonist isoproterenol stimulated de novo RNA synthesis measured using assays of transcription initiation (Boivin et al., 2006 Cardiovasc Res. 71:69-78). In contrast, stimulation of endothelin receptors, another G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that localizes to the nuclear membrane, resulted in decreased RNA synthesis. To investigate the signalling pathway(s) involved in GPCR-mediated regulation of RNA synthesis, nuclei were isolated from intact adult rat hearts and treated with receptor agonists in the presence or absence of inhibitors of different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/PKB pathways. Components of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascades as well as PKB were detected in nuclear preparations. Inhibition of PKB with triciribine, in the presence of isoproterenol, converted the activation of the βAR from stimulatory to inhibitory with regards to RNA synthesis, while ERK1/2, JNK and p38 inhibition reduced both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated activity. Analysis by qPCR indicated an increase in the expression of 18S rRNA following isoproterenol treatment and a decrease in NFκB mRNA. Further qPCR experiments revealed that isoproterenol treatment also reduced the expression of several other genes involved in the activation of NFκB, while ERK1/2 and PKB inhibition substantially reversed this effect. Our results suggest that GPCRs on the nuclear membrane regulate nuclear functions such as gene expression and this process is modulated by activation/inhibition of downstream protein kinases within the nucleus.
20811699	Histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid and depsipeptide sensitize retinoblastoma cells to radiotherapy by increasing H2AX phosphorylation and p53 acetylation-phosphorylation.	Although p53 is intact in most cases of retinoblastoma, it is largely inactivated by the ubiqutin-proteasome system through interaction with murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX). The present study showed that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and depsipeptide (FK228) synergistically enhanced ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis, associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in Y79 and WER1-Rb1 human retinoblastoma cells. Both VPA and FK228 enhanced IR-induced phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser139 preceding apoptosis. Exposure of cells to IR in the presence of VPA or FK228 induced the accumulation of p53 acetylated at Lys382 and phosphorylated at Ser46 through the reduction of binding affinity with MDM2 and MDMX. These results suggest that acetylation of p53 by HDAC inhibitors is a promising new therapeutic target in refractory retinoblastoma.
20827267	Estrogen receptor genotypes, menopausal status, and the effects of tamoxifen on lipid levels: revised and updated results.	We previously reported that the ESR1 XbaI genotypes were associated with baseline and tamoxifen-induced serum lipid profiles. The analysis in that study was carried out by PCR followed by restriction-enzyme digestion. After reanalysis using more robust TaqMan assays, the findings related to ~10% of the genotypes for the ESR1 XbaI single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were revised. For the other genotypes (i.e., ESR1 PvuII, ESR2, and CYP2D6), the results were nearly identical to those in the previous study. Upon reanalysis, previously reported associations between the ESR1 Xba1 genotypes and baseline triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were no longer observed. Previously reported associations between the ESR1 XbaI genotypes and tamoxifen-induced changes in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were also no longer observed. However, the following observations from the original report did not change: (i) the levels of circulating lipids are lower in women taking tamoxifen; (ii) there is an association between the ESR2-02 genotypes and changes in triglyceride levels; and (iii) neither ESR1 PvuII nor CYP2D6 is associated with any changes in serum lipid concentrations in patients receiving treatment with tamoxifen.
20870038	ST segment elevation by current-to-load mismatch: an experimental and computational study.	Recently, we demonstrated that ajmaline caused ST segment elevation in the heart of an SCN5A mutation carrier by excitation failure in structurally discontinuous myocardium. In patients with Brugada syndrome, ST segment elevation is modulated by cardiac sodium (I(Na)), transient outward (I(to)), and L-type calcium currents (I(CaL)).
21036126	Ibudilast, a mixed PDE3/4 inhibitor, causes a selective and nitric oxide/cGMP-independent relaxation of the intracranial vertebrobasilar artery.	Ibudilast, a mixed phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3/4 inhibitor, is a cerebral vasodilator widely used in Japan for treating post-stroke dizziness. However, little studies have been conducted on the vasorelaxant effects of PDE inhibitors in the vertebrobasilar artery associated with dizziness onset. The in vitro vasorelaxant properties of ibudilast were, therefore, investigated by comparing with known selective PDE inhibitors, using vertebrobasilar arteries. Vasorelaxant activities of PDE3, PDE4, PDE5 inhibitors, and ibudilast were assessed in 5-hydroxytryptamine precontracted ring preparations from rabbit intracranial and extracranial vertebrobasilar arteries. Ibudilast more selectively relaxed the intracranial than extracranial artery. Similarly, selective PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors showed higher selectivity for intracranial arteries. Furthermore, like selective PDE4 inhibitor, the vasorelaxation by ibudilast accompanied by increase in cAMP levels was inhibited by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 in intracranial arteries. Next, it was examined whether nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling is involved in this vasorelaxation in intracranial arteries. The suppression of NO/cGMP signaling by an NO synthase inhibitor or a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor potentiated the vasorelaxion by a PDE3 inhibitor and reduced that by a PDE4 inhibitor, while either suppression of the signaling had little influence on that by ibudilast. These results suggest that ibudilast has the high vasoselectivity for intracranial artery based on a mixed PDE3 and PDE4-inhibition, and effectively relaxes intracranial arteries independently of NO/cGMP signaling because of its vasorelaxation compensated by either PDE3- or PDE4-inhibition depending on the state of NO/cGMP signaling change.
21054754	Activity of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.	• To evaluate the impact and distribution of a single phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5 I) dose (udenafil or tadalafil) in prostate tissue and plasma in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
21091776	Dalteparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, promotes angiogenesis mediated by heparin-binding VEGF-A in vivo.	Tumors are angiogenesis dependent and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a heparin-binding protein, is a key angiogenic factor. As chemotherapy and co-treatment with anticoagulant low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are common in cancer patients, we investigated whether angiogenesis in vivo mediated by VEGF-A is modulated by metronomic-type treatment with: (i) the LMWH dalteparin; (ii) low-dosage cytostatic epirubicin; or (iii) a combination of these two drugs. Using the quantitative rat mesentery angiogenesis assay, in which angiogenesis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of very low doses of VEGF, dalteparin sodium (Fragmin(®) ) and epirubicin (Farmorubicin(®) ) were administered separately or in combination by continuous subcutaneous infusion at a constant rate for 14 consecutive days. Dalteparin was administered at 27, 80, or 240 IU/kg/day, i.e., doses that reflect the clinical usage of this drug, while epirubicin was given at the well-tolerated dosage of 0.4 mg/kg/day. While dalteparin significantly stimulated angiogenesis in an inversely dose-dependent manner, epirubicin did not significantly affect angiogenesis. However, concurrent treatment with dalteparin and epirubicin significantly inhibited angiogenesis. The effect of dalteparin is the first demonstration of a proangiogenic effect of any LMWH in vivo. The fact that co-treatment with dalteparin and epirubicin significantly inhibited angiogenesis suggests a complex drug effect.
21129983	Vasorelaxant effect of flavonoids through calmodulin inhibition: Ex vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches.	In our search for potential antihypertensive agents, a series of structurally-related flavonoids was screened. Ex vivo and in vitro biological evaluations indicated that compounds 1-7 displayed an important vasorelaxant effect on the endothelium-intact (E(+)) and -denuded (E(-)) aortic rings test. Their in vitro anti-calmodulin (CaM) properties were determined by means of the inhibitory effect on the activation of the calmodulin-sensitive cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE1) assay. Molecular modeling experiments were also performed in order to explore the probable binding site of 1-7 with CaM, and the results indicated that they could bind to the protein in the same pocket as trifluoperazine (TFP), a well-known CaM inhibitor.
21143836	ASIC3 channels integrate agmatine and multiple inflammatory signals through the nonproton ligand sensing domain.	Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have long been known to sense extracellular protons and contribute to sensory perception. Peripheral ASIC3 channels represent natural sensors of acidic and inflammatory pain. We recently reported the use of a synthetic compound, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ), to identify a novel nonproton sensing domain in the ASIC3 channel, and proposed that, based on its structural similarity with GMQ, the arginine metabolite agmatine (AGM) may be an endogenous nonproton ligand for ASIC3 channels.
21177475	meso-Transdiene analogs inhibit vesicular monoamine transporter-2 function and methamphetamine-evoked dopamine release.	Lobeline, a nicotinic receptor antagonist and neurotransmitter transporter inhibitor, is a candidate pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine abuse. meso-Transdiene (MTD), a lobeline analog, lacks nicotinic receptor affinity, retains affinity for vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and, surprisingly, has enhanced affinity for dopamine (DA) and serotonin transporters [DA transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT), respectively]. In the current study, MTD was evaluated for its ability to decrease methamphetamine self-administration in rats relative to food-maintained responding. MTD specifically decreased methamphetamine self-administration, extending our previous work. Classical structure-activity relationships revealed that more conformationally restricted MTD analogs enhanced VMAT2 selectivity and drug likeness, whereas affinity at the dihydrotetrabenazine binding and DA uptake sites on VMAT2 was not altered. Generally, MTD analogs exhibited 50- to 1000-fold lower affinity for DAT and were equipotent or had 10-fold higher affinity for SERT, compared with MTD. Representative analogs from the series potently and competitively inhibited [(3)H]DA uptake at VMAT2. (3Z,5Z)-3,5-bis(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)-1-methylpiperidine (UKMH-106), the 3Z,5Z-2,4-dichlorophenyl MTD analog, had improved selectivity for VMAT2 over DAT and importantly inhibited methamphetamine-evoked DA release from striatal slices. In contrast, (3Z,5E)-3,5-bis(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)-1-methylpiperidine (UKMH-105), the 3Z,5E-geometrical isomer, inhibited DA uptake at VMAT2, but did not inhibit methamphetamine-evoked DA release. Taken together, these results suggest that these geometrical isomers interact at alternate sites on VMAT2, which are associated with distinct pharmacophores. Thus, structural modification of the MTD molecule resulted in analogs exhibiting improved drug likeness and improved selectivity for VMAT2, as well as the ability to decrease methamphetamine-evoked DA release, supporting the further evaluation of these analogs as treatments for methamphetamine abuse.
21208749	Variant in oxytocin receptor gene is associated with amygdala volume.	The oxytocin system plays a significant role in modulating stress responses in animals and humans; perturbations in this system may contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorder. Attempts to identify clinically relevant genetic variants in the oxytocin system have yielded associations between polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene and both autism and major depression. To date, however, little is known about how such variants affect brain structures implicated in these disorders. Applying a manual tracing procedure to high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images, amygdala volumes were measured in 51 girls genotyped on OXTR rs2254298(G>A), a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with psychopathology. Results of this study indicate that despite having greater gray matter volume, participants homozygous for the G allele were characterized by smaller volumes of both left and right amygdala than were carriers of the A allele. A subsequent whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed additional genotype-mediated volumetric group differences in the posterior brain stem and dorsomedial anterior cingulate cortex. These findings highlight one neurobiological pathway by which oxytocin gene variants may increase risk for psychopathology. Further research is needed to characterize the mechanism by which this polymorphism contributes to anatomical variability and to identify functional correlates of these alterations in regional brain volume.
22293084	Ivacaftor potentiation of multiple CFTR channels with gating mutations.	The investigational CFTR potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) increased CFTR channel activity and improved lung function in subjects with CF who have the G551D CFTR gating mutation. The aim of this in vitro study was to determine whether ivacaftor potentiates mutant CFTR with gating defects caused by other CFTR gating mutations.
22517326	The ancient drug salicylate directly activates AMP-activated protein kinase.	Salicylate, a plant product, has been in medicinal use since ancient times. More recently, it has been replaced by synthetic derivatives such as aspirin and salsalate, both of which are rapidly broken down to salicylate in vivo. At concentrations reached in plasma after administration of salsalate or of aspirin at high doses, salicylate activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Salicylate binds at the same site as the synthetic activator A-769662 to cause allosteric activation and inhibition of dephosphorylation of the activating phosphorylation site, threonine-172. In AMPK knockout mice, effects of salicylate to increase fat utilization and to lower plasma fatty acids in vivo were lost. Our results suggest that AMPK activation could explain some beneficial effects of salsalate and aspirin in humans.
22520687	(+)-naloxone, an opioid-inactive toll-like receptor 4 signaling inhibitor, reverses multiple models of chronic neuropathic pain in rats.	Previous work demonstrated that both the opioid antagonist (-)-naloxone and the non-opioid (+)-naloxone inhibit toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and reverse neuropathic pain expressed shortly after chronic constriction injury. The present studies reveal that the TLR4 contributes to neuropathic pain in another major model (spinal nerve ligation) and to long established (2-4 months) neuropathic pain, not just to pain shortly after nerve damage. Additionally, analyses of plasma levels of (+)-naloxone after subcutaneous administration indicate that (+)-naloxone has comparable pharmacokinetics to (-)-naloxone with a relatively short half-life. This finding accounts for the rapid onset and short duration of allodynia reversal produced by subcutaneous (+)-naloxone. Given that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has also recently been implicated in neuropathic pain, cell lines transfected with either TLR4 or TLR2, necessary co-signaling molecules, and a reporter gene were used to define whether (+)-naloxone effects could be accounted for by actions at TLR2 in addition to TLR4. (+)-Naloxone inhibited signaling by TLR4 but not TLR2. These studies provide evidence for broad involvement of TLR4 in neuropathic pain, both early after nerve damage and months later. Additional, they provide further support for the TLR4 inhibitor (+)-naloxone as a novel candidate for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
2253700	Stereoselectivity of procyclidine binding to muscarinic receptor subtypes M1, M2 and M4.	The goals of the present study were: (1) to investigate the binding properties of (R)- and (S)-procyclidine and two achiral derivatives of muscarinic M1, M2 and M4 receptor subtypes and (2) to identify the interactions which allow these receptors to discriminate between the two stereoisomers. (R)-Procyclidine showed a higher affinity for human neuroblastoma NB-OK 1 muscarinic M1 and rat striatum muscarinic M4 receptors, as compared to rat cardiac M2 receptors. (S)-Procyclidine had a 130-fold lower affinity than (R)-procyclidine for M1 and M4 receptors, and a 40-fold lower affinity for M2 receptors. Pyrrinol, the achiral diphenyl derivative with the cyclohexyl group of (S)-procyclidine replaced by a phenyl group, has an eight-fold lower affinity for M1 and M4 receptors, as compared to (R)-procyclidine, and a three-fold lower affinity for M2 receptors. Hexahydro-procyclidine, the corresponding achiral dicyclohexyl compound, had a 10- to 20-fold lower affinity than (R)-procyclidine for the three receptors. The increase in binding free energy, which is observed when the phenyl and cyclohexyl groups of procyclidine are separately replaced by cyclohexyl and phenyl groups, respectively, was additive in the case of M1, M2 and M4 receptors. This indicates that the muscarinic receptor stereoselectivity was based on the coexistence of two binding sites, one preferring a phenyl rather than cyclohexyl group and the second preferring a cyclohexyl rather than a phenyl group. In addition, there were also binding sites for the hydroxy moiety and the protonated amino group of the ligands. The greater affinity and stereoselectivity of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors for (R)-procyclidine reflected the better fit of the cyclohexyl group of (R)-procyclidine to the subsite of M1 and M4 as compared to M2 receptors.
22790794	Novel electrophysiological properties of dronedarone: inhibition of human cardiac two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels.	Dronedarone is currently used for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Pharmacological inhibition of cardiac two-pore-domain potassium (K(2P)) channels results in action potential prolongation and has recently been proposed as novel antiarrhythmic strategy. We hypothesized that blockade of human K(2P) channels contributes to the electrophysiological efficacy of dronedarone in AF. Two-electrode voltage clamp and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology was used to record K(2P) currents from Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. All functional human K(2P) channels were screened for dronedarone sensitivity, revealing significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of cardiac K(2P)2.1 (TREK1; IC(50) = 26.7 μM) and K(2P)3.1 channels (TASK1; IC(50) = 18.7 μM) with maximum current reduction of 60.3 and 65.5 % in oocytes. IC(50) values obtained from mammalian cells yielded 6.1 μM (K(2P)2.1) and 5.2 μM (K(2P)3.1). The molecular mechanism of action was studied in detail. Dronedarone block affected open and closed channels. K(2P)3.1 currents were reduced in frequency-dependent fashion in contrast to K(2P)2.1. Mutagenesis studies revealed that amino acid residues implicated in K(2P)3.1 drug interactions were not required for dronedarone blockade. The class III antiarrhythmic drug dronedarone targets multiple human cardiac two-pore-domain potassium channels, including atrial-selective K(2P)3.1 currents. K(2P) current inhibition by dronedarone represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of action that extends the multichannel blocking profile of the drug.
2307235	Inactivation of the uterine estrogen receptor binding of estradiol during P-450 catalyzed metabolism of chlorotrianisene (TACE). Speculation that TACE antiestrogenic activity involves covalent binding to the estrogen receptor.	Chlorotrianisene (TACE) exhibits in vitro little or no binding to the uterine estrogen receptor (ER) but demonstrates potent estrogenic activity in vivo, indicating that TACE is a proestrogen/proantiestrogen. Our earlier studies demonstrated that the incubation of TACE with rat liver microsomes and NADPH generates a reactive intermediate (T*) which binds covalently to proteins. The current study examined the possibility that T* may inactivate the uterine ER. The incubation of TACE with rat liver microsomes and NADPH in the presence of rat uteri, under conditions which generate T*, markedly decreased the binding capacity of the ER for [3H]estradiol (E2). The evidence indicates that ER inactivation was probably due to irreversible (covalent) binding of T* to the E2 binding site. The possibility that the antiestrogenic action of TACE and of other triphenylethylenes involves such a novel mechanism is discussed.
23134735	Development and validation of a high-throughput intrinsic ATPase activity assay for the discovery of MEKK2 inhibitors.	The kinase MEKK2 (MAP3K2) has recently been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, selective inhibition of MEKK2 may be a novel strategy for cancer therapy. To identify inhibitors of MEKK2 kinase activity, we have developed a novel activity assay for MEKK2 based on the discovery that recombinant purified MEKK2 has intrinsic ATPase activity. This MEKK2 ATPase assay was validated for enzyme identity and enzymatic purity by multiple methods including mass spectrometry analysis, testing different sources of MEKK2 and comparing ATPase assay IC50 data for multiple inhibitors to literature values and to IC50 data generated using MEKK2 binding and transphosphorylation assays. Taken together, these data indicated that genuine MEKK2 activity was being measured in this assay and no other ATPases contributed to the signal. A miniaturized version of the assay was validated for high-throughput screening, and compound libraries were screened. The screening hits generated comparable potencies in the MEKK2 intrinsic ATPase, binding, and transphosphorylation assays. We identified a novel MEKK2 inhibitor and confirmed that crizotinib and bosutinib are potent in vitro inhibitors of MEKK2 activity with IC50 values of <100 nM. Thus, this assay has utility for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of MEKK2 activity.
23190395	Selective targeting of distinct active site nucleophiles by irreversible SRC-family kinase inhibitors.	Src-family tyrosine kinases play pivotal roles in human physiology and disease, and several drugs that target members of this family are in clinical use. None of these drugs appear to discriminate among closely related kinases. However, assessing their selectivity toward endogenous kinases in living cells remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the design of two Src-directed chemical probes, each consisting of a nucleoside scaffold with a 5'-electrophile. A 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoate (1) reacts with the conserved catalytic lysine (Lys295) and shows little discrimination among related kinases. By contrast, a 5'-vinylsulfonate (2) reacts with a poorly conserved, proximal cysteine (Cys277) found in three Src-family and six unrelated kinases. Both 1 and 2 bear an alkyne tag and efficiently label their respective endogenous kinase targets in intact cells. Using 1 as a competitive probe, we determined the extent to which ponatinib, a clinical Bcr-Abl inhibitor, targets Src-family kinases. Remarkably, while ponatinib had little effect on endogenous Fyn or Src, it potently blocked the critical T-cell kinase, Lck. Probes 1 and 2 thus enable competitive profiling versus distinct kinase subsets in living cells.
23204107	CXC-chemokine receptor 4 antagonist AMD3100 promotes cardiac functional recovery after ischemia/reperfusion injury via endothelial nitric oxide synthase-dependent mechanism.	CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) regulates the retention of stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow (BM), and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 improves recovery from coronary ligation injury by mobilizing stem/progenitor cells from the BM to the peripheral blood. Thus, we investigated whether AMD3100 also improves recovery from ischemia/reperfusion injury, which more closely mimics myocardial infarction in patients, because blood flow is only temporarily obstructed.
23250851	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of romiplostim in animals.	Romiplostim is a novel thrombopoiesis-stimulating peptibody that targets the thrombopoietin c-Mpl receptor, resulting in increased platelet production. The pharmacodynamic-mediated disposition (PDMDD) and its stimulatory effect on platelet production in Sprague-Dawley rats, rhesus monkeys, and cynomolgus monkeys following IV bolus and SC administration at various dose levels were determined.
23372609	Avanafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: initial data and clinical key properties.	Orally active, selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5, cyclic GMP PDE), such as sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are currently the first-choice treatment options for the clinical management of erectile dysfunction (ED) of various etiologies and severities. However, a significant number of patients remain dissatisfied with the available therapies due a lack of efficacy or discomfort arising from adverse events. Several new PDE5 inhibitors, among which are avanafil (TA-1790), lodenafil, mirodenafil, udenafil, SLX-2101, JNJ-10280205 and JNJ-10287069, have recently been approved and introduced into the market or are in the final stages of their clinical development. Avanafil (marketed in the US under the brand name STENDRA(™)) has been developed by VIVUS Inc. (Mountain View, CA, USA) and has recently received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of male ED. The drug has demonstrated improved selectivity for PDE5, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a fast onset of action and a plasma half-life that is comparable to sildenfil and vardenafil. In phase II and phase III clinical trials that included a large number of patients, avanafil has been shown to be effective and well tolerated. Owing to its favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, avanafil is considered as a promising new option in the treatment of ED. The present article summarizes the initial data and clinical key properties of avanafil.
23468082	Combined targeting of FGFR2 and mTOR by ponatinib and ridaforolimus results in synergistic antitumor activity in FGFR2 mutant endometrial cancer models.	Activating mutations in FGFR2 have been identified as potential therapeutic targets in endometrial cancer, typically occurring alongside genetic alterations that disrupt the mTOR pathway, such as PTEN loss. These observations suggest that the mTOR pathway may act in concert with oncogenic FGFR2 to drive endometrial cancer growth in a subset of patients. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic potential of a rational drug combination based on the simultaneous targeting of mutant-FGFR2 and mTOR-driven signaling pathways in endometrial cancer cells.
23526464	Ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel potent inhibitor of oncogenic RET mutants associated with thyroid cancer.	The RET tyrosine kinase encoding gene acts as a dominantly transforming oncogene in thyroid carcinoma and other malignancies. Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is in advanced clinical experimentation in leukemia.
23539538	Synergistic growth-inhibitory effects of ponatinib and midostaurin (PKC412) on neoplastic mast cells carrying KIT D816V.	Patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including mast cell leukemia, have a poor prognosis. In these patients, neoplastic mast cells usually harbor the KIT mutant D816V that confers resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We examined the effects of the multi-kinase blocker ponatinib on neoplastic mast cells and investigated whether ponatinib acts synergistically with other antineoplastic drugs. Ponatinib was found to inhibit the kinase activity of KIT G560V and KIT D816V in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1. In addition, ponatinib was found to block Lyn- and STAT5 activity in neoplastic mast cells. Ponatinib induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in HMC-1.1 cells (KIT G560V(+)) and HMC-1.2 cells (KIT G560V(+)/KIT D816V(+)) as well as in primary neoplastic mast cells. The effects of ponatinib were dose-dependent, but higher IC50-values were obtained in HMC-1 cells harboring KIT D816V than in those lacking KIT D816V. In drug combination experiments, ponatinib was found to synergize with midostaurin in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis in HMC-1 cells and primary neoplastic mast cells. The ponatinib+midostaurin combination induced substantial inhibition of KIT-, Lyn-, and STAT5 activity, but did not suppress Btk. We then applied a Btk short interfering RNA and found that Btk knockdown sensitizes HMC-1 cells against ponatinib. Finally, we were able to show that ponatinib synergizes with the Btk-targeting drug dasatinib to produce growth inhibition in HMC-1 cells. In conclusion, ponatinib exerts major growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic mast cells in advanced systemic mastocytosis and synergizes with midostaurin and dasatinib in inducing growth arrest in neoplastic mast cells.
23563275	Ability of the new AT1 receptor blocker azilsartan to block angiotensin II-induced AT1 receptor activation after wash-out.	The recently approved angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB) azilsartan strongly reduces blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. We previously reported that azilsartan showed unique binding behavior to the AT1 receptor because of its 5-oxo-1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety. However, the ability of azilsartan to block Ang II-dependent AT1 receptor activation is not yet clear.
23563700	Novel FGFR inhibitor ponatinib suppresses the growth of non-small cell lung cancer cells overexpressing FGFR1.	Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Identifying new oncogenic drivers and developing efficient inhibitors through molecular targeting approaches are crucial for improving therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) with ponatinib inhibits the cell growth in both established and primary lung cancer cells overexpressing FGFR1. Eighty-eight non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and paired normal tissue specimens were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for FGFR1 gene expression. We identified four cell lines and two newly established primary lung cancer cultures that showed high FGFR1 expression levels, and evaluated the effect of the novel FGFR1 inhibitor ponatinib on cell growth. Approximately 50% (30 out of 59) NSCLC specimens expressed FGFR1>2-fold compared with their adjacent normal counterparts using quantitative RT-PCR. Ponatinib treatment of established NSCLC cell lines expressing higher levels of FGFR1 resulted in marked cell growth inhibition and suppression of clonogenicity. This growth inhibition was associated with inactivation of FGFR1 and its downstream targets. FGFR1 knockdown by shRNA achieved similar results when compared to treatment with ponatinib. Furthermore, ponatinib was able to significantly inhibit the growth of primary lung cancer cultures in vitro. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 kinase activity with ponatinib may be effective for the treatment of lung cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR1.
23583259	Agonism of human pregnane X receptor by rilpivirine and etravirine: comparison with first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.	Rilpivirine and etravirine are second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors approved recently by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of various genes controlling diverse biological functions. The present study investigated the effects of rilpivirine and etravirine on the activity of human PXR (hPXR), including the mode of activation, and compared them to those of efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine, which are first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In transiently transfected HepG2 cells, rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, activated human, mouse, and rat PXR. Results from mechanistic studies indicated that rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, bound to the ligand-binding domain of hPXR, as assessed by a transactivation assay and by a competitive ligand-binding assay using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer; triggered nuclear translocation of a green fluorescence protein-tagged hPXR, as visualized by confocal imaging; and recruited steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), SRC-2, and SRC-3 to hPXR, as demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assays. Rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, increased hPXR target gene (CYP3A4) expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. In summary, select non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors activated human and rodent PXR. Rilpivirine, etravirine, and efavirenz, but not nevirapine or delavirdine, were identified as agonists of hPXR, as assessed in mechanistic experiments, and inducers of CYP3A4, as determined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
2432979	Binding and functional profiles of the selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonists trihexyphenidyl and dicyclomine.	The selectivity profiles of the muscarinic receptor antagonists dicyclomine and trihexyphenidyl have been examined in binding and functional studies and compared with those of pirenzepine and atropine. Dicyclomine, trihexyphenidyl and pirenzepine demonstrated the highest affinity for the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype as revealed in competition experiments against [3H]-pirenzepine labelling of cortical membranes. Their affinity values lay in a narrow range (3.7-14 nM) approaching that of atropine (1.6 nM). Competition experiments against [3H]-N-methylscopolamine in cardiac and glandular (salivary) membranes revealed differences between the drugs examined. Dicyclomine, trihexyphenidyl and pirenzepine displayed low affinity for the cardiac and intermediate affinity for the glandular receptors. Thus, the drugs appeared to discriminate between the M1 (cortical) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). However, atropine displayed similar affinities for either subtype with IC50s varying only slightly (1.6-4.6 nM). The rank order of selectivity was: pirenzepine greater than dicyclomine greater than trihexyphenidyl greater than atropine. Mirroring the binding data, pirenzepine, dicyclomine and trihexyphenidyl showed a tenfold greater ability at inhibiting M1-receptor mediated ganglionic responses (McN A-343 pressor effect in pithed rats and nictitating membrane contraction in cats) than at inhibiting peripheral muscarinic responses in the heart and cardiovascular smooth muscle (vagal bradycardia in rats and cats and vagally-induced vasodilatation in cats). The muscarinic antagonists so far examined can be categorized into two groups. Trihexyphenidyl, dicyclomine and pirenzepine, included in one group, are characterized by a higher affinity for the neuronal (M1) muscarinic receptor, hence they antagonize functional responses mediated by the M1 subtype. Atropine, a member of the other group, shows essentially no selectivity. 6 Differentiation of M1 and peripheral muscarinic receptor subtypes appears to be a property not confined to tricyclics such as pirenzepine but shared by diverse chemical structures. Both trihexyphenidyl and dicyclomine appear to be useful pharmacological tools in the classification of muscarinic receptor subtypes.
24947465	Brexpiprazole I: in vitro and in vivo characterization of a novel serotonin-dopamine activity modulator.	Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712, 7-{4-[4-(1-benzothiophen-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butoxy}quinolin-2(1H)-one) is a novel drug candidate in clinical development for psychiatric disorders with high affinity for serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline receptors. In particular, it bound with high affinity (Ki < 1 nM) to human serotonin 1A (h5-HT1A)-, h5-HT2A-, long form of human D2 (hD2L)-, hα1B-, and hα2C-adrenergic receptors. It displayed partial agonism at h5-HT1A and hD2 receptors in cloned receptor systems and potent antagonism of h5-HT2A receptors and hα1B/2C-adrenoceptors. Brexpiprazole also had affinity (Ki < 5 nM) for hD3-, h5-HT2B-, h5-HT7-, hα1A-, and hα1D-adrenergic receptors, moderate affinity for hH1 (Ki = 19 nM), and low affinity for hM1 receptors (Ki > 1000 nM). Brexpiprazole potently bound to rat 5-HT2A and D2 receptors in vivo, and ex vivo binding studies further confirmed high 5-HT1A receptor binding potency. Brexpiprazole inhibited DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine)-induced head twitches in rats, suggestive of 5-HT2A antagonism. Furthermore, in vivo D2 partial agonist activity of brexpiprazole was confirmed by its inhibitory effect on reserpine-induced DOPA accumulation in rats. In rat microdialysis studies, brexpiprazole slightly reduced extracellular dopamine in nucleus accumbens but not in prefrontal cortex, whereas moderate increases of the dopamine metabolites, homovanillic acid and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl-acetic acid), in these areas also suggested in vivo D2 partial agonist activity. In particular, based on a lower intrinsic activity at D2 receptors and higher binding affinities for 5-HT1A/2A receptors than aripiprazole, brexpiprazole would have a favorable antipsychotic potential without D2 receptor agonist- and antagonist-related adverse effects. In conclusion, brexpiprazole is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator with a unique pharmacology, which may offer novel treatment options across a broad spectrum of central nervous system disorders.
2502209	Differences between binding of one-chain and two-chain tissue plasminogen activators to non-cross-linked and cross-linked fibrin clots.	Interaction of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) with fibrin plays a key role in regulation of plasminogen activation and clot dissolution. Previous investigations of t-PA-fibrin interaction, using incorporation of t-PA into polymerizing fibrin clots, have suggested that no significant differences exist in the binding of one-chain or two-chain t-PA to non-cross-linked or cross-linked fibrin. In the present study, binding of 125I-labeled and affinity-purified one-chain and two-chain forms of t-PA to preformed non-cross-linked or cross-linked, sonicated suspension of fibrin was investigated. Interaction of one-chain t-PA with cross-linked fibrin involved a single type of binding site with dissociation constant (kd) of 0.58 mumol/L and a stoichiometry (n) of 1.5. Interaction of one-chain t-PA with non-cross-linked fibrin, however, involved two classes of binding sites with dissociation constants of 0.32 and 1.5 mumol/L and corresponding number of binding sites equal to 0.57 and 2.0, respectively. In contrast to the binding of one-chain t-PA to cross-linked fibrin by a limited number of sites, two-chain t-PA appeared to involve a considerably greater number of sites (minimum six) whose dissociation constant was 3.2 mumol/L. Interaction of two-chain t-PA with non-cross-linked fibrin also showed the presence of many binding sites (minimum seven) with approximate dissociation constant of 6.4 mumol/L, as well as a few (n = 0.012) high-affinity sites with a kd of 0.011 mumol/L epsilon-Aminocaproic acid did not completely reverse the binding of either one-chain t-PA or two-chain t-PA to fibrin. The present findings suggest that the fibrin-binding properties of t-PA undergo considerable changes on proteolytic conversion from one-chain to two-chain t-PA, catalyzed under physiologic conditions by plasmin. The cleavage of one-chain t-PA to two-chain t-PA allows to bind to a large number of low-affinity binding sites on fibrin. Cross-linking of fibrin by factor XIIIa results in masking of high-affinity binding sites that are present in non-cross-linked fibrin. We propose that both plasmin and factor XIIIa play an important regulatory role in dissolution of blood clots by modulating t-PA-fibrin interaction.
25354738	Secukinumab efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: subanalysis from ERASURE, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.	Secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Efficacy and safety of secukinumab was evaluated in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis as part of a large Phase 3 global study (ERASURE). In this 52-week, double-blind study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01365455, JapicCTI-111529), 87 patients from Japan (11.8% of 738 patients randomized in the overall study population) were equally randomized to receive secukinumab 300 mg or 150 mg, or placebo once weekly at baseline and at Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, then every 4 weeks. Co-primary endpoints (Week 12) were ≥75% improvement in psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI 75) from baseline and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment scale (IGA mod 2011 0/1) versus placebo. PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses at Week 12 were superior with secukinumab 300 mg (82.8% and 55.2%, respectively) or 150 mg (86.2% and 55.2%, respectively) versus placebo (6.9% and 3.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). Greater than 90% improvement in PASI (PASI 90) was also superior with secukinumab 300 mg (62.1%) or 150 mg (55.2%) versus placebo (0.0%) at Week 12 (P < 0.0001 for both). Clinical responses were sustained up to Week 52 in the majority of patients. During a 12-week induction period, adverse event incidences were 48.3% with secukinumab 300 mg, 55.2% with 150 mg, and 41.4% with placebo. Secukinumab showed robust and sustainable efficacy in symptom reduction for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the Japanese patients.
25534555	Tasimelteon: a selective and unique receptor binding profile.	Hetlioz(®) (tasimelteon) is the first approved treatment in the United States for Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24). We present here data on the in vitro binding affinity of tasimelteon for both human melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, as well as the extended screen of other receptors and enzymes. Results indicate that tasimelteon is a potent Dual Melatonin Receptor Agonist (DMRA) with 2.1-4.4 times greater affinity for the MT2 receptor believed to mediate circadian rhythm phase-shifting (Ki = 0.0692 nM and Ki = 0.17 nM in NIH-3T3 and CHO-K1 cells, respectively), than for the MT1 receptor (Ki = 0.304 nM and Ki = 0.35 nM, respectively). Tasimelteon was also shown to have no appreciable affinity for more than 160 other pharmacologically relevant receptors and several enzymes.
2568436	The enhanced daily excretion of urinary methylamine in rats treated with semicarbazide or hydralazine may be related to the inhibition of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activities.	The effects of amine oxidase inhibitors upon the daily urinary excretion of monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA) and ammonia in the rat have been examined. Administration of hydralazine (5 mg kg-1) or semicarbazide (100 mg kg-1), drugs which irreversibly inhibit semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAO) but not monoamine oxidase (MAO), enhanced MMA excretion by around three- to six-fold above pretreatment levels, whereas no effect of pargyline (25 mg kg-1), a selective irreversible inhibitor of MAO was found. No apparent changes in DMA or TMA excretion in response to drug-treatment were observed. Ammonia excretion also was generally unchanged except for an apparent marked increase (approximately four-fold) over the 24 h following semicarbazide, a result which might be explained if ammonia is a degradation product of semicarbazide metabolism in the rat. With recent evidence that MMA is a substrate in-vitro for SSAO activities, results here may indicate that SSAO or related enzymes are involved in endogenous MMA turnover.
25850750	Pharmacokinetics and Tolerability of the Novel Oral Prostacyclin IP Receptor Agonist Selexipag.	Targeting the prostacyclin pathway is an effective treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Patients with PAH have a deficiency of prostacyclin and prostacyclin synthase. Selexipag is an orally available and selective prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist. Selexipag is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite ACT-333679, also a selective and potent agonist at the IP receptor.
2586634	Cholinomimetic activities of minaprine.	The cholinomimetic activities of the antidepressant drug minaprine have been investigated, in vitro and in vivo, in rodents. Minaprine, and its metabolite SR 95070B [3-(2-morpholinoethylamino)-4-methyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl) pyridazine hydrochloride] selectively displaced [3H]-pirenzepine from its cortical and hippocampal binding sites, and only weakly inhibited the binding of [3H]-N-methylscopolamine in either the rat cerebellum, heart and salivary glands, or the guinea-pig ileum. In mice, none of these drugs induced the typical cholinergic side-effects up to lethal doses. Minaprine and SR 95070B antagonized rotations induced by an intrastriatal injection of pirenzepine in mice, after intraperitoneal and/or oral administration. Minaprine also antagonized atropine-induced mydriasis in mice. Both minaprine and SR 95070B potentiated the tremorigenic effect of oxotremorine without inducing tremor when injected alone. Finally, minaprine and SR 95070B, after parenteral and/or oral injection, antagonized the scopolamine-induced deficit in passive avoidance learning, and enhanced short-term retention in the social memory test, in rats. The muscarinic agonists arecoline, oxotremorine and RS 86 [2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8 diazaspiro-4,5 decan-1,3 dion hydrobromide], as well as the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors physostigmine and tacrine were active in most of these models. These results indicate that minaprine, and its metabolite SR 95070B, have cholinomimetic activities which could be, at least in part, mediated by their selective affinity for M1 muscarinic receptors. Thus minaprine could represent a potential useful drug for the treatment of senile dementias and cognitive impairments occurring in elderly people.
25981132	Extent of radiosensitization by the PARP inhibitor olaparib depends on its dose, the radiation dose and the integrity of the homologous recombination pathway of tumor cells.	The PARP inhibitor olaparib is currently tested in clinical phase 1 trials to define safe dose levels in combination with RT. However, certain clinically relevant insights are still lacking. Here we test, while comparing to single agent activity, the olaparib dose and genetic background dependence of olaparib-mediated radiosensitization.
2625138	Cyproheptadine displays high affinity for muscarinic receptors but does not discriminate between receptor subtypes.	The affinity of cyproheptadine for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was investigated in vitro by functional experiments in field-stimulated vas deferens of the rabbit (ganglionic M1- and cardiac M2-receptors) and in guinea-pig ileum (smooth muscle M3-receptors). Cyproheptadine displayed high but similar affinity for all muscarinic receptor subtypes studied (pA2 = 7.99-8.02). In contrast, (+)-telenzepine (M1 over M2 and M3), and for mefurtramine (M2 over M3 and M1) were found to be selective.
26384788	Targeted inhibition of MEK1 by cobimetinib leads to differentiation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.	Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common childhood malignancies. Currently, high risk NB carries a poor outcome and significant treatment related toxicities and, thus has been a focus for new therapeutics research in pediatric oncology. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib, as a single agent and in combinations, on the growth, survival and differentiation properties against a molecularly representative panel of NB cell lines.
26510944	Cariprazine: First Global Approval.	Cariprazine (Vraylar) is an oral atypical antipsychotic originated by Gedeon Richter. It is a potent dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist, which preferentially binds to the D3 receptor. Cariprazine also has partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. In September 2015, cariprazine received its first global approval in the USA for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It is also in development in a variety of countries for the treatment of schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms (phase III), as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (phase II/III) and for the treatment of bipolar depression (phase II). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of cariprazine leading to this first approval for schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
26658258	Clobetasol and Halcinonide Act as Smoothened Agonists to Promote Myelin Gene Expression and RxRγ Receptor Activation.	One of the causes of permanent disability in chronic multiple sclerosis patients is the inability of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to terminate their maturation program at lesions. To identify key regulators of myelin gene expression acting at the last stages of OPC maturation we developed a drug repositioning strategy based on the mouse immortalized oligodendrocyte (OL) cell line Oli-neu brought to the premyelination stage by stably expressing a key factor regulating the last stages of OL maturation. The Prestwick Chemical Library of 1,200 FDA-approved compound(s) was repositioned at three dosages based on the induction of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) expression. Drug hits were further validated using dosage-dependent reproducibility tests and biochemical assays. The glucocorticoid class of compounds was the most highly represented and we found that they can be divided in three groups according to their efficacy on MBP up-regulation. Since target identification is crucial before bringing compounds to the clinic, we searched for common targets of the primary screen hits based on their known chemical-target interactomes, and the pathways predicted by top ranking compounds were validated using specific inhibitors. Two of the top ranking compounds, Halcinonide and Clobetasol, act as Smoothened (Smo) agonists to up-regulate myelin gene expression in the Oli-neuM cell line. Further, RxRγ activation is required for MBP expression upon Halcinonide and Clobetasol treatment. These data indicate Clobetasol and Halcinonide as potential promyelinating drugs and also provide a mechanistic understanding of their mode of action in the pathway leading to myelination in OPCs. Furthermore, our classification of glucocorticoids with respect to MBP expression provides important novel insights into their effects in the CNS and a rational criteria for their choice in combinatorial therapies in de-myelinating diseases.
2723642	Solubilization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites from cat cerebral cortex.	The present study demonstrates for the first time the solubilization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) from cat cerebral cortex. Of all detergents tested [digitonin, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), Tween 20, deoxycholate, and Triton X-100] in the presence of NaCl, the best solubilization (15% of initial activity) was obtained using 0.5% of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS plus 2 M NaCl. Specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 to membrane-bound and solubilized PBS was saturable, yielding equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of 1.3 +/- 0.2 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 nM, respectively, and maximal numbers of binding sites of 1,435 +/- 150 and 980 +/- 126 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The KD value of PK 11195 binding to solubilized PBS obtained from experimental kinetic analysis was 0.95 +/- 0.09 nM. The relative potencies of various compounds (PK 11195, Ro 5-4864, diazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, and Ro 15-1788) in displacing [3H]PK 11195 specific binding from membrane-bound and solubilized PBS were similar. Most of the solubilized binding activity was destroyed by heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min or by treatment with 2 M guanidinium chloride, which indicates the presence of a protein-binding site in the solubilized preparation. Over 85% of the solubilized binding activity was retained after 1 week at 4 degrees C, which will enable future application of purification procedures without major concern for stability of the material.
2828423	Characterization of a polyclonal antibody to the mu opioid receptor.	Active opioid receptors have been solubilized from bovine striatal synaptosomal membranes and purified approximately 4000-fold using a combination of affinity and hydroxyapatite chromatography. The affinity column was constructed by attaching hybromet, a newly synthesized opioid ligand with high affinity for the mu receptor, to a solid support matrix. A polyclonal antibody was generated to opioid receptors by injection of the purified receptor preparation into female New Zealand rabbits. The specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by receptor competition and immunoprecipitation studies. Immunological titration of opioid binding activity from rat brain showed that the antibody was able to displace specific binding of [3H]etorphine (universal opioid) and [3H]dihydromorphine (mu opioid) from rat membranes, but was ineffective against the binding of [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (kappa [3H]D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin (delta opioid) or [3H]phencyclidine (phencyclidine/sigma receptor ligand). The antibody was able to precipitate the Mr 94,000 component of the 125I-labeled affinity-purified receptor, a finding which suggests that this subunit may be an opioid recognition component. By indirect immunofluorescence, the antibody was shown to bind specifically to the plasma membranes of the neurotumor cell line NCB-20 (neuroblastoma X Chinese hamster brain hybrid cells), which has high affinity opioid receptors. The observed fluorescence in the neuroblastoma cells was prevented by pre-adsorption of the antibody with purified receptor from rat brain. These results indicate that the antibody is specific for opioid receptors and may prove useful in the precise localization of opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems by immunohistochemical procedures.
2835832	Relation of diltiazem binding sites to opioid receptor subtypes in the guinea-pig brain.	Interactions between diltiazem and opioids in guinea-pig brain membrane preparations were examined. Diltiazem did not inhibit bindings of 3H-dihydromorphine (3H-DHM), 3H-ethylketocyclazocine (3H-EKCZ) and 3H-naloxone (3H-NOX) but inhibited binding of 3H-[D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-enkephalin (3H-DADLE). In 3H-DADLE binding, diltiazem decreased the reciprocal indices of affinity (Kd values) of 3H-DADLE without changing on the maximal saturable binding (B. max) in guinea-pig brain membranes. These effects of diltiazem on the binding of 3H-DADLE were enhanced by 2.5mM CaCl2. Morphine, EKCZ, naloxone and even DADLE did not change the binding of 3H-diltiazem. These results suggest that the current of information concerning diltiazem and DADLE binding sites is one-way only so that no interaction exists.
2887435	Discriminative stimulus properties of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT): implications for understanding the actions of novel anxiolytics.	8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT) has effects both characteristic of a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) agonist and antagonist. To investigate the mechanism(s) of action of 8-OHDPAT in vivo, rats were trained to discriminate 8-OHDPAT (0.4 mg/kg) from saline and given various neuroactive compounds during substitution test sessions. Of the 5-HT agonists tested, d-lysergic acid diethylamide, 5-methoxy-n,n-dimethyltryptamine, quipazine, Ru 24969 and 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine did not mimic the training drug; the dopamine agonists apomorphine and SKF 38393 as well as the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine engendered predominantly saline-lever responding. However, the novel anxiolytics buspirone and ipsapirone as well as the ergot derivative lisuride substituted completely for 8-OHDPAT. In combination tests, 5-HT (ketanserin, metergoline, methysergide, pirenperone), dopamine (haloperidol) and norepinephrine antagonists (prazosin, propranolol) failed to attenuate the 8-OHDPAT cue. The similar stimulus properties of 8-OHDPAT and the novel anxiolytics (buspirone, ipsapirone) are mirrored by the common abilities of these agents to selectively inhibit 5-HT1A binding and release punished responding. Thus, the subpopulation of 5-HT1A receptors may mediate the behavioral effects of these compounds in animals and, in turn, the anxiolytic effects of buspirone and ipsapirone in humans. Although not primarily selective for 5-HT, lisuride may also mimic 8-OHDPAT by direct or indirect stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors.
2904117	The relative selectivity of anticholinergic drugs for the M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes.	Anticholinergic drugs are used to treat a number of neurologic disorders, including parkinsonism, vestibular disturbances, and dystonia. Traditionally, these drugs have been thought to act in similar fashion, as competitive antagonists at a single class of muscarinic receptors, and not to differ significantly in their therapeutic efficacy. Recently, however, pharmacologic studies have shown that the novel antagonist pirenzepine is capable of recognizing heterogeneity among muscarinic receptors; high-affinity pirenzepine sites have been classified as M1 sites and low-affinity sites as M2. This study examined whether the anticholinergics currently available for treatment of neurologic symptoms have selectivity for these subtypes and whether they differ in their degree of selectivity; the study showed that these drugs do demonstrate selectivity. All had greater affinity for the M1 site, indicated by higher affinity for rat forebrain membranes, where M1 predominates, than hindbrain preparations, where M2 predominates. The degree of selectivity varied greatly; some compounds, such as ethopropazine, had little M1 selectivity, whereas others, such as scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, and biperiden, were quite selective, like pirenzepine. It is unknown whether these differences in selectivity have any immediate therapeutic implications. However, these results support the emerging concept of muscarinic receptor subtypes and the prospect of developing more selective agents, with enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
2913485	Tacrine protection of acetylcholinesterase from inactivation by diisopropylfluorophosphate: a circular dichroism study.	Tacrine (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine) showed an apparent noncompetitive inhibition of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with a dissociation constant, Ki, of 8.5 nM. It altered the CD bands of AChE in the near-UV region, which monitor the local conformation of aromatic side groups, but not those in the far-UV region, which measure the secondary structure. An extrinsic CD band was induced at 348 nm, with a molar ellipticity of 35,000 deg cm2 dmol-1 (bases on tacrine), when each AChE subunit (Mr = 67,000) was saturated with one tacrine (mol/mol). With this band as a probe, the bound tacrine could be displaced by edrophonium or decamethonium, both of which are known to bind to the anionic site at the active center of AChE, but not by propidium, which binds to the peripheral site of the enzyme. Tacrine protected AChE from inactivation by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). AChE completely lost its enzymatic activity when 1 mol of DFP was bound per mol of subunit upon incubation of 7 microM AChE (subunit) with 100 microM DFP for 40 min, but tacrine-treated AChE retained 60% of its activity and bound only 0.2 mol of DFP per mol of subunit under similar conditions. The corresponding CD, at 348 nm, of the AChE-tacrine-DFP complex increased or decreased gradually, depending on the order of addition of tacrine and DFP, and reached an equilibrium value (80% of its original) after 2 days. The difference absorption spectrum of the AChE-tacrine-DFP complex was the same as that of the AChE-tacrine complex. These results suggest that the protective effect of tacrine may be due to steric hindrance at the esteratic site of the enzyme.
2933041	Slow calcium channel blockers and calmodulin. Effect of felodipine, nifedipine, prenylamine and bepridil on cardiac sarcolemmal calcium pumping ATPase.	The effect of four slow Ca2+ channel blockers (felodipine, nifedipine, prenylamine and bepridil) that possess the ability to bind to calmodulin (CaM) section and to inhibit myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) on CaM-regulated Ca2+ pumping ATPase of cardiac sarcolemma (SL) and brain cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) was studied. The ability of these drugs to inhibit Ca2+ pumping ATPase correlated with their inhibitory effect on CaM-activated Ca2+-dependent PDE. Nifedipine was unable to inhibit markedly both enzymes. Prenylamine also was a weak inhibitor, which was unexpected because of its CaM binding potency. Felodipine (10-50 microM) and bepridil (50 microM) markedly reduced activities of SL Ca2+ pumping ATPase and PDE. Striking differences were, however, demonstrated when Ca2+ and CaM concentrations, respectively, were increased. Previously it was reported that inhibition of the SL Ca2+ pumping ATPase by the CaM antagonist calmidazolium could be overcome by increasing Ca2+ concentrations (J. M. J. Lamers and J. T. Stinis, Cell Calcium 4, 281-294, 1983). Felodipine (10-50 microM) in the present study, appeared to be equipotent with calmidazolium in reducing Ca2+ pumping ATPase, but increasing Ca2+ up to 12.2 microM could not counteract this effect. Felodipine (2-10 microM) also inhibited brain PDE noncompetitively with respect to CaM contrary to the competitive effectors calmidazolium and bepridil. On the other hand, bepridil (10-20 microM) decreased or increased Ca2+ pumping ATPase activity depending on the Ca2+ concentration (0.29 and 12.2 microM, respectively) used. These findings suggest at least two types of CaM antagonists, which can be discriminated on basis of their inhibition patterns of PDE and heart SL Ca2+ pumping ATPase.
2985086	Opiate receptor binding profile in the rabbit cerebellum and brain membranes.	The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) and maximal binding capacities of tritiated dihydromorphine (DHM), [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) and human beta-endorphin (beta-EP) in rabbit cerebellum and brain membranes have been investigated. Binding of tritiated DHM and DADLE was adequately described by a single affinity class of binding sites, while that of EKC required two affinity sites. Binding of tritiated beta-EP was also consistent with a single affinity class of binding sites by Scatchard analysis, but inhibition of the binding with type selective opiate receptor ligands revealed multiple sites. Sequential displacement of a broad spectrum opiate ligand, diprenorphine (DIP), by type selective ligands showed that cerebellum membranes are relatively rich in mu (40%) and deficient in K (12%) binding sites, while brain membranes are relatively rich in K (32%) and deficient in mu (12%) binding sites. beta-EP displaces 88 and 73% of tritiated DIP from cerebellum and brain membranes, respectively, suggesting multiple sites of beta-EP binding.
3020249	Synthesis of novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril and related compounds. A divergence of structure-activity relationships for non-sulfhydryl and sulfhydryl types.	The synthesis and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting activities of quinapril (CI-906, 22), its active diacid (CI-928, 33), and its dimethoxy analogue (CI-925, 25) are reported. These tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives possess equivalent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy to enalapril. Sulfhydryl analogues with the same structural variation are also highly potent. In contrast, tetrahydro-1-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid and homologous isoindoline-1-carboxylic acid analogues show a striking divergence in potency between the two types, sulfhydryl analogues being essentially inactive, while non-sulfhydryl analogues are equipotent with the proline prototype. This is the first evidence suggesting that alternate binding modes may exist for the two major structural classes of small molecule ACE inhibitors.
3022601	Suggestion of a role for calmodulin and phosphorylation in regulation of rabbit ileal electrolyte transport: effects of promethazine.	Suggestion of a role for protein phosphorylation in the regulation of intestinal active NaCl transport was found by studying the effects of low concentrations of promethazine on Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphorylation of ileal microvillus membranes and on active ileal electrolyte transport. Ca2+-CaM increased the phosphorylation of six microvillus peptides (Mr 137,000, 116,000, 77,000, 58,000, 53,000, and 50,000) in a concentration-dependent manner. Promethazine inhibited the Ca2+-CaM-induced increases in each of these phosphorylations. The effect of promethazine was concentration dependent, with concentrations of 5-12 microM (mean 8 microM) causing 50% inhibition. Promethazine also caused a concentration-dependent increase in net Cl absorption and decrease in the ileal short-circuit current, with 9 microM promethazine causing a change in short-circuit current 50% of maximum. The promethazine effect on microvillus membrane phosphorylation was specific, since neither cAMP- and cGMP-induced phosphorylation in the microvillus membrane nor the stimulation by Ca2+-CaM of myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation of myosin light chain were affected by promethazine. The similar, and unusual sensitivity to low concentrations of promethazine on ileal microvillus membrane phosphorylation increased by Ca2+-CaM and on ileal electrolyte transport is consistent with Ca2+-CaM-dependent microvillus membrane phosphorylation being involved in the regulation of active electrolyte transport in ileal absorptive cells.
3036471	Opiate receptor subtypes in the rat hypothalamus and neurointermediate lobe.	The potent opiate radioligands [3H]etorphine, [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (EKC), and [3H]naloxone, bound specifically and saturably to a single class of membrane-binding sites in rat neurointermediate lobe (NIL), with Kd values of 3.7, 24, and 51 nM, respectively. In the hypothalamus (Ht), [3H]etorphine bound to specific and saturable sites with a Kd of 2.9 nM. Binding-inhibition studies with [3H]etorphine and unlabeled etorphine-HCl as well as [3H]EKC and unlabeled EKC, revealed high and low affinity binding sites in rat Ht and NIL as well as in the neural lobe of the bovine pituitary gland. [3H]naloxone also bound specifically to two classes of sites in Ht membranes, but to only a single class of low affinity sites in NIL membranes. Specific binding represented 80-90% of total [3H]etorphine binding, about 75% of total [3H]EKC binding, and 45-55% of total [3H]naloxone binding at 22 C in NIL and Ht, respectively. Relative binding potencies derived from Ki values for binding-inhibition studies of [3H]etorphine with opioid peptides and opiates were: NIL, etorphine-HCl greater than dynorphin A greater than naloxone-HCl greater than dynorphin-(1-9) greater than beta-endorphin much greater than alpha-neoendorphin approximately (Leu5)enkephalin approximately DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol); Ht, etorphine HCl greater than naloxone-HCl greater than beta-endorphin greater than dynorphin A much greater than DAGO greater than morphiceptin much greater than (Leu5)enkephalin. Specific [3H]etorphine binding was also demonstrable after preincubation of NIL membranes with DAGO and (Leu5)enkephalin and after preincubation of Ht membranes with morphiceptin and (Leu5)enkephalin; such binding could be displaced by nonradioactive dynorphin A. In addition, [3H]etorphine binding to bovine neural lobe was displaceable by naloxone-HCl, with an ED50 of 43 nM. Specific ligands for sigma-opiate receptors, such as (+)SKF 10,047 (N-allylnorcyclazocine), phencyclidine (PCP), and (-)cyclazocine, displaced specifically bound [3H]etorphine and [3H]EKC from NIL membranes only at high (micromolar) concentrations. However, specific [3H]PCP sites were of higher affinity in NIL and Ht membranes, with similar Kd values of 102 and 190 nM respectively, and different concentrations (0.15 and 1.32 pmol/mg protein, respectively). These data have revealed several differences in the opiate-binding properties of rat Ht and NIL membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3037028	Characterization of kappa opioid receptors in neurosecretosomes from bovine posterior pituitary.	The binding properties of opioid receptors on isolated nerve terminals (neurosecretosomes) from bovine posterior pituitaries were characterized. Both [3H]etorphine and [3H]ethylketocyclazocine ([3H]EKC) showed high-affinity binding with complex binding isotherms, consistent with the presence of multiple classes of binding sites. [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin showed no specific binding and failed to displace [3H]etorphine at high concentrations, indicating the absence of mu, delta, or benzomorphan (kappa 2) sites. Mathematical modelling of the data suggested the presence of three classes of binding sites. The first was of high affinity with Kd values of 0.9 and 2.0 nM for etorphine and EKC, respectively. The second class of sites appeared to bind etorphine with a KD of 150 nM, and EKC with extremely low affinity (unmeasurable binding). The third class of sites was characterized by KD values of 7 and 2 microM for etorphine and EKC, respectively. These results indicate that the nerve terminals of bovine posterior pituitary contain opioid binding sites of the kappa type. Furthermore, these binding sites appear heterogeneous, consisting of at least two and possibly more subtypes or states.
3076376	beta-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase I of Escherichia coli: nucleotide sequence of the fabB gene and identification of the cerulenin binding residue.	The fabB gene of E. coli encoding beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I has been isolated by complementation and sequenced. The enzyme has been purified and its NH2-terminal residues sequenced. Identification of the active site was accomplished by tagging with 3H-cerulenin and radio sequencing of the region. Comparison of the deduced primary structures of the fabB gene product with the FAS2 gene product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed the probable active site in chalcone synthases of higher plants.
3208836	Muscarinic M1, M2 receptor binding. Relationship with functional efficacy.	A comparison has been made between [3H]pirenzepine binding to the M1 receptor population of rat cerebral cortex and [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding to M2 receptors in rat cardiac membranes. Several standard muscarinic antagonists including trihexyphenidyl HCl, benztropine, biperidin and 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide) showed some selectivity for the M1 binding assay. Dicyclomine and hexahydrosiladifenidol were the only antagonists with a selectivity approaching that of pirenzepine. Gallamine and AFDX-116 were the only M2 (cardiac) selective antagonists. Muscarinic agonists displayed profiles which could be classified into two groups, apparently related to their intrinsic activity. One group displayed apparent selectivity for the heart, with low Hill coefficients and contained full agonists such as acetylcholine. The second group displayed less selectivity, intermediate Hill coefficients and contained partial agonists such as pilocarpine. Thus muscarinic agents can distinguish between different tissues not only on the basis of receptor selectivity, but also by recognition of high and low agonist affinity states. Thus the intrinsic activity of a muscarinic agonist may reflect an apparent but not true receptor-mediated selectivity.
4091799	The interaction of hydralazine with a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase in brown adipose tissue of the rat. Its use as a radioactive ligand for the enzyme.	Hydralazine is a potent irreversible inhibitor of the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) found in brown fat. Initially it may act on the enzyme as a competitive inhibitor, but irreversible inhibition occurs rapidly in a concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. The presence of primary amines known to be substrates for the enzyme, but not of secondary amines, which are not metabolized by SSAO, diminishes this rate of inactivation, whereas removal of O2 is without effect. The kinetic pattern of inactivation of SSAO by hydralazine is consistent with an active-site-directed site-saturable binding followed by the development of an irreversible enzyme-inhibitor complex. [3H]Hydralazine, used as an affinity label for SSAO, shows saturable binding to brown-fat membranes. This binding is inhibited by other inhibitors of SSAO. The rate of binding to membrane pellets containing SSAO is not affected by substrates for the enzyme. However, if solubilized partially purified SSAO preparations are used instead, the rate of binding is lowered in the presence of the SSAO substrate benzylamine. 3H-labelled material solubilized from [3H]hydralazine-treated membrane pellets by Triton X-100 at that detergent/protein ratio which releases SSAO from membranes shows the same gel-filtration characteristics as SSAO and appears by lentil lectin-agarose affinity chromatography to contain similar carbohydrate moieties. 3H-labelled material, partially purified by gel filtration and affinity chromatography, produces predominantly a single band of radioactivity on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The position of this band corresponds to an Mr of about 94 000, almost exactly half the Mr already estimated for the functional unit of SSAO. Radiolabelled hydralazine may thus be used as a label for purified SSAO, but it is not specific enough to be suitable as a ligand in vivo.
6124875	Discrimination of three opiate receptor binding sites with the use of a computerized curve-fitting technique.	The presence of different types of opiate binding sites was investigated with the use of a computerized, weighted, nonlinear least-squares regression program. The experimental data were obtained from four groups. Each of three labeled opiate ligands was displaced using each of the same unlabeled ligands. The resulting nine different ligand combinations of each group were evaluated by use of a curve-fitting program. The four groups consisted of the kappa ligand ethylketocyclazocine, the sigma ligand SKF 10047, and the oripavine derivatives etorphine and diprenorphine, each in conjunction with the delta opiate receptor ligand (D-Ala2,D-Leu5)-enkephalin and the mu opiate receptor ligand dihydromorphine. The binding model which best fitted each of the four groups suggested the existence of three different binding sites in the rat brain homogenate. Two of these sites conform to the previously described mu and delta sites. A third site (R3) displayed high affinity for ethylketocyclazocine, SKF 10047, etorphine, and diprenorphine but very low affinity for dihydromorphine and [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin. Naloxone, cyclazocine, and dynorphin-(1--13) had high affinity for R3. Behavioral data support the interpretation that the R3 site may represent a kappa site at which SKF 10047 acts antagonistically.
6247160	Structure-activity relationships of enkephalin analogs at opiate and enkephalin receptors: correlation with analgesia.	We have investigated the influence of physico-chemical parameters (chemical structure and lipophilicity), biochemical properties (catabolism, affinity for 3H-etorphine binding sites and 3H-(D-Ala)2-Leu5-enkephalin amide binding sites) and biological activity in isolated organs (guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens) on the regulation of analgesia induced after intracerebroventricular injection of various enkephalin analogs. The selectivity of these metabolically stable analogs for micro- and beta-receptors, present in guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens respectively, depends on the C-terminal amino acid and also on the nature of the second D-amino-acid. A strong correlation exists between activity in guinea-pig ileum and affinity for 3H-etorphine binding sites suggesting that these sites in rat brain have properties identical to those of micro-receptors characterized in guinea-pig ileum. Similarly, the affinity for 3H-(D-Ala)2-Leu5-enkephalin amide binding sites in mouse brain is correlated to the activity in mouse vas deferens and suggests that central beta-receptors are not different from peripheral beta-receptors. If we consider morphine-like drugs and enkephalin analogs containing the same C-terminal amino acid as the enkephalins, there is a good correlation between activity on micro-receptors (affinity for 3H-etorphine binding sites and activity in guinea-pig ileum) and the antinociceptive activity. These results support the hypothesis that micro-receptors are strongly involved in the analgesic effect. However, when proline is the C-terminal amino acid, the antinociceptive activity was enhanced without any concomitant increase in the affinity. This activity enhancement was the same for each analog and a similar correlation (identical to what was found with other opioid peptides and opiates) could still be established. The reason for such a potentiation of the activity remains to be elucidated.
6451613	Deletion mapping and heterogenote analysis of a mutation responsible for osmosis-sensitive growth, spectinomycin resistance, and alteration of cytoplasmic membrane in Escherichia coli.	Lambda transducing phages carrying Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleic acid of various lengths from the aroE-rpsL region were lysogenized into the F'3 plasmid and were used for heterogenote analysis of YM101, a sucrose-dependent, spectinomycin-resistant mutant of E. coli. Three characteristics of the mutant strain, resistance to spectinomycin, sucrose dependence of growth, and lack of I-19 protein in the cytoplasmic membrane, were shown to be the result of a mutation in a region designated delta 53-spcl. This region extends over 3.6-kilobase pairs and is located within a cluster of ribosomal genes. The mutation is recessive to the wild-type allele.
6646243	Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase in monoaminergic neurons in the rat brain.	The prevention by six reversible and selective monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors (alpha-ethyl-tryptamine, harmaline, 4-methoxyamphetamine, amiflamine [FLA 336(+)], N-desmethylamiflamine [FLA 788(+)] and N,N-desmethylamiflamine [FLA 668(+)] of the phenelzine-induced irreversible MAO inhibition in the rat brain was examined. By using crude synaptosome preparations of hypothalamus and striatum incubated with low substrate concentrations of 14C-serotonin (1 X 10(-7) M), 14C-noradrenaline (2.5 X 10(-7) M) and 14C-dopamine (2.5 X 10(-7) M) in the absence and presence of selective amine uptake inhibitors (alaproclate, maprotiline and amfonelic acid, respectively), it was possible to determine the deaminating activities inside and outside the specific aminergic synaptosomes. Thus, with this technique the protection of MAO by the reversible inhibitors administered orally 1 h prior to the subcutaneous injection of phenelzine against the phenelzine effect could be determined inside and outside the specific aminergic neurons. It was found that alpha-ethyltryptamine, 4-methoxyamphetamine and particularly amiflamine and FLA 788(+) were more potent inside than outside the serotonergic neurons. FLA 668(+) was a selective inhibitor of noradrenergic MAO, to which also 4-methoxyamphetamine, amiflamine and FLA 788(+), but not alpha-ethyltryptamine had some preference. Harmaline had no certain preference for MAO in any of the aminergic neurons. At high doses of FLA 668(+) a preference for dopaminergic MAO was observed. Since pretreatment of the rats with norzimeldine or desipramine antagonized the preferences for serotonergic or noradrenergic MAO, it is plausible to conclude that the compounds showing these preferences are accumulated in the neurons by the membranal uptake systems.
6704779	Dantrolene--in vitro studies in malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) and normal skeletal muscle.	Dantrolene sodium, a hydantoin analogue, is efficacious in the therapy of malignant hyperthermia (MH). In order to improve our knowledge of the mode of action of dantrolene, we have examined the influence of dantrolene sodium on: (1) twitch and resting tensions, in the absence and the presence of caffeine, of intact skeletal muscle fascicles; and (2) caffeine induced tension rises of single chemically skinned skeletal muscle fascicles. We have found that dantrolene appears to exert its beneficial action on malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) skeletal muscle by an indirect action on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Thus dantrolene inhibits twitch tensions of skeletal muscle fascicles, probably by indirectly preventing the release of calcium from the SR. To a lesser extent dantrolene inhibits caffeine induced contractures of skeletal muscle fascicles, probably by indirectly accelerating the uptake of calcium into the SR. Because the former effect is greater than the latter in vivo dantrolene sodium is effective only when given prior to total loss of calcium from the SR. Vigilant temperature and EKG monitoring of all patients during anaesthesia is, therefore, essential.
6789797	Effect of amodiaquine on histamine level and histamine-methyltransferase activity in the rat brain.	Amodiaquine, 10(-5) M, totally inhibited the activity of histamine-methyltransferase (HMT) in the rat brain. Both peripheral (60 mg/kg i.p.) and central (50 and 100 microgram i.vt.) administration of the drug substantially reduced the HMT activity. Amodiaquine given i.p. or i.vt., in various doses, did not change the endogenous histamine (HI) level in the rat brain at any time studied (1-24 h). Amodiaquine (60 or 120 mg/kg i.p.) administered together with an inhibitor of diamine oxidase, i.e. aminoguanidine (either peripherally or centrally) had no effect on the endogenous HI content. Possible involvement of mechanisms other than methylation or oxidation in regulation of the endogenous HI level in the rat brain is discussed.
7286847	[Antihypertensive effects of labetalol in three types of hypertensive models of rats (author's transl)].	Effects on blood pressure and heart rate of labetalol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with alpha-blocking action were studied in conscious hypertensive rats (SHR, DOCA-hypertensive rats and renal hypertensive rats (RHR)). Labetalol with two asymmetric carbon atoms consists of an equal proportion of two racemates. In SHR, prevention of the development of hypertension was noted after 1.5 weeks of chronic oral administration of labetalol 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, while bradycardia occurred beginning with the day of administration. Thus, the prevention of the development of hypertension appeared much earlier than in the case of the other beta-blockers. Antihypertensive effects and bradycardia were also noted in DOCA hypertensive rats and RHR after oral administration of labetalol 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day for six days. In DOCA hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive effect was more pronounced that in the RHR. These findings are in contrast to those with other beta-blockers. Other beta-blockers produced antihypertensive effects only in SHR. It is concluded that not only the beta-blocking action, but also the alpha-blocking action of labetalol plays an important role in the antihypertensive effects of labetalol.
7362049	Dantrolene dose response in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) swine: method to obtain prophylaxis and therapeusis.	The authors examined the thesis that a dose of dantrolene producing 95 per cent of maximal muscle relaxation (ED95) would effectively prevent or treat malignant hyperthermia (MH). In one group of four pigs sensitive to malignant hyperthermia (MHS) a dose response to intravenous dantrolene was determined by quantitation of toe twitch tension. From these data, the ED95 relaxant dose (3.5 mg/kg) was derived. In a second group of four MHS pigs, the ED95 dantrolene dose was administered prior to MH challenge with succinylcholine, 2 mg/kg, and halothane, 1.5 per cent. MH was prevented in each animal, while measurements of arterial pressure, arterial blood-gas, pH and lactate values, rectal temperature, and heart rate were done. Later, MH rapidly developed in the same four animals when they were again challenged. When treated with the ED95 dose, each animal survived. Finally, each pig was challenged without dantrolene prophylaxis or therapeusis, and all succumbed from MH. Previous studies have shown the efficacious use of dantrolene in prevention or treatment of porcine MH, but doses used have varied, without rationale. The present study shows that in MHS pigs the ED95 muscle relaxant dose of dantrolene (3.5 mg/kg) successfully prevents and treats MH.
7473177	Moexipril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor: pharmacological characterization and comparison with enalapril.	The pharmacodynamic profile of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril and its active diacid, moexiprilat, was studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, moexiprilat exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACE and purified ACE from rabbit lung. Upon oral administration of moexipril (10 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats, plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased to undetectable levels, plasma ACE activity was inhibited by 98% and plasma angiotensin I concentration increased 8.6-fold 1 h after dosing. At 24 h, plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II concentrations had returned to pretreatment levels, whereas plasma ACE activity was still inhibited by 56%. Four-week oral administration of moexipril (0.1-30 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered blood pressure and differentially inhibited ACE activity in plasma, lung, aorta, heart and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. Equidose treatment (10 mg/kg/day) with moexipril and enalapril over 4 weeks led to comparable decreases in blood pressure, inhibition of plasma ACE and reduction of plasma angiotensinogen and to a similar attenuation of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and potentiation of the depressor responses to bradykinin. In contrast, ACE inhibition in aorta, heart and lung was significantly greater with moexipril than with enalapril, whereas in the kidney both drugs inhibited ACE activity to a similar extent. In summary, moexipril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that is comparable to enalapril in potency and duration of antihypertensive activity. The results of the present study demonstrate that 1) the antihypertensive potency of a given ACE inhibitor cannot be predicted from its in vitro characteristics and 2) the degree of blood pressure reduction does not correlate with tissue ACE inhibition.
7488490	Alterations of inositol polyphosphates in skeletal muscle during porcine malignant hyperthermia.	Malignant hyperthermia (MH) may result from increased intracellular calcium concentrations. Increased 1,4,5-IP3 concentrations could mediate this increase in Ca2+. In this study we measured inositol polyphosphates in selectively bred MH susceptible (MHS) and MH non-susceptible (MHN) swine. MH crisis was induced by halothane challenge, and dantrolene was administered in order to measure inositol polyphosphates after MH reversal. Muscle biopsies of skeletal muscles of the hind limbs were obtained in random order and inositol polyphosphates determined by high pressure liquid chromatography using a metal dye detection method. Inositol polyphosphates were determined in three groups: (1) MHS vs MHN basal, (2) during MH crisis induced by halothane and (3) following treatment with dantrolene after halothane challenge. Clinical variables (P(_)VO2, P(-)VCO2, PE'CO2 and pH) indicated that MH was readily induced in MHS swine. Basal concentrations of all inositol polyphosphates were higher in MHS swine compared with MHN swine. After halothane challenge, 1,3,4-IP3, 1,3,4,6-IP4 and 1,3,4,5-IP4 concentrations increased in MHS animals compared with the respective baseline values, whereas no changes in MHN animals could be detected. Dantrolene administration decreased inositol polyphosphate concentrations in MHS swine. MHN swine showed no changes in inositol polyphosphates after dantrolene. These findings indicate that inositol polyphosphates may be involved in metabolic changes after triggering and treatment of MH.
7511759	Mechanisms of the natriuretic effects of neutral endopeptidase inhibition in Dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats.	To explore the mechanisms of the renal effects of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition, the effects of an NEP inhibitor, candoxatril (UK 79,300; UK), in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) and salt-resistant (SR) rats were examined. UK dose-dependently decreased blood pressure (BP) in SS rats (20 mg/kg: 174 +/- 5 vs. 155 +/- 8 mm Hg, p < 0.01) but not in SR rats. Urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of both rat strains receiving high-salt diets was increased to a greater extent than that of rats receiving low-salt diets. Basal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) level in hypertensive SS rats was higher than in SR rats (192 +/- 18 vs. 118 +/- 24 pg/ml, p < 0.05). UK increased ANP levels in the plasma and urine two- and 11-fold, respectively. UK-induced increases in UNaV, urinary cyclic GMP, and plasma ANP concentrations were significantly augmented by coadministration of a clearance receptor agonist, C-ANF(4-23) or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Thus, the effects of NEP inhibition appear to be potentiated by the reduced receptor-mediated metabolism of ANP. This may explain the greater response to the NEP inhibitor in Dahl rats with hypertension or high-salt feeding.
7518029	Differential influence of haloperidol and sulpiride on dopamine receptors and peptide mRNA levels in the rat striatum and pituitary.	We examined the effect of chronic administration (14 days) of haloperidol (2 mg/kg/day) or sulpiride (100 mg/kg/day), on the mRNA levels of various genes in the rat striatum and pituitary by quantitative in situ and Northern blot hybridizations. In the pituitary, haloperidol and sulpiride induced similar increases of mRNAs of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) (+65% and +73%), prolactin (PRL) (+821% and +840%) and growth hormone (GH) (+32% and +47%), but sulpiride induced a greater increase of D2R mRNA (+125%) than haloperidol (+92%). In the striatum, sulpiride and haloperidol had different effects: sulpiride induced a higher increase than haloperidol of both preproenkephalin A (PPA) mRNA (+67% versus +47%) and D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) mRNAs (+72% versus +40%). Moreover, haloperidol and sulpiride had opposite effects on substance P (SP) mRNA. Haloperidol decreased the amount of SP mRNA by 20% while sulpiride increased it by 20%. The D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) mRNA level was not significantly modified after either treatment. Our results demonstrate that the effect of a chronic haloperidol treatment on striatal dopamine receptors and neuropeptide mRNA levels is different to that of sulpiride, whereas it is similar on pituitary hormones mRNA levels.
7520908	Risperidone: a novel antipsychotic with balanced serotonin-dopamine antagonism, receptor occupancy profile, and pharmacologic activity.	The interaction of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone (the principal active metabolite), and clozapine with neurotransmitter receptors was investigated in vitro using animal brain tissue homogenates and cloned human receptors expressed in cells and ex vivo using quantitative receptor autoradiography in rat and guinea pig brain sections. In vitro, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone had similar binding profiles, and their highest affinity was for 5-HT2A receptors (cloned human, Ki 0.4 nM); affinities for other 5-HT-receptor subtypes were at least 100 times lower. Risperidone bound to 5-HT2A receptors with 20 times greater affinity than clozapine and 170 times greater affinity than haloperidol. Clozapine primarily bound to histamine H1 receptors and haloperidol to dopamine D2 receptors. The binding affinity of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone for the D2 family of receptors (D2L, D2S, D3, D4) was one order of magnitude lower than their affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. Risperidone bound to D2 and D3 receptors with 50 and 20 times greater affinity than clozapine and was only 2 to 3 times less potent than haloperidol. All compounds bound with similar affinities to D4 receptors (Ki 5-9 nM), and their affinities for D1 receptors were 100 times lower than for D4 receptors. The ex vivo receptor occupancy profile of the compounds matched the in vitro receptor binding profile. A conspicuous property of risperidone, not seen for the other compounds, was the shallow occupancy curve at D2 receptors in the striatum and mesolimbic brain area. Moreover, it was observed that antagonism of strong D2-receptor stimulation by apomorphine in rats was achieved at less than 50% D2 occupancy by the antipsychotics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7530204	Blockade of the discriminative stimulus effects of DOI by MDL 100,907 and the 'atypical' antipsychotics, clozapine and risperidone.	In a drug discrimination paradigm, the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists, ritanserin, ICI 169,369 (2-(2-dimethylaminoethylthio-3-phenylquinoline hydrochloride) and mianserin, and the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, antagonised the discriminative stimulus effects of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist, DOI ((2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodohenyl)-2-aminopropan) (0.63 mg/kg i.p.). Effective dose50 (ED50) values were: 0.32, 0.39, 0.15 and 0.03 mg/kg s.c., respectively. While the novel, selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB 200,646 (N-(1-methyl-5-iodolyl)-N'-(3-pyridyl) urea hydrochloride) was inactive (10 mg/kg s.c. and 20 mg/kg p.o.), the highly selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, MDL 100,907 (R-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl]-4- piperidine-methanol) very potently (ED50 = 0.0006) abolished the action of DOI. MDL 100,907 may display antipsychotic properties and the 'atypical' antipsychotics, clozapine, risperidone and sertindole, each of which possesses marked affinity at 5-HT2A receptors, abolished the discriminative stimulus effects of DOI (ED50 values of 0.07, 0.03 and 0.33 mg/kg, respectively). In contrast, haloperidol (0.16) was ineffective. These data demonstrate that 5-HT2A receptors mediate the discriminative stimulus effects of DOI and support the hypothesis that an antagonistic action at 5-HT2A receptors contributes to the in vivo actions of 'atypical' antipsychotics.
7540578	Danazol decreases transcription of estrogen receptor gene in human monocytes.	1. Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and its mRNA to approximately 50 and 20%, respectively in monocytes. 2. Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes. 3. Danazol decreased the transcription rate of ER gene to approximately 50% in monocytes in a run-on assay. 4. Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for ER gene, which leads to the reduction of ER mRNA and ER expressions in monocytes.
7548008	Heterogeneity of antidepressant binding sites on the recombinant rat serotonin transporter SERT1.	Antidepressant drugs block the uptake of serotonin into serotonergic nerve terminals and blood platelets. Here, binding of the tricyclic antidepressant [3H]imipramine to the recombinant rat serotonin transporter SERT1 expressed in human embryonic kidney cells was found to be nonhomogeneous. Scatchard analysis and competition experiments revealed the existence of two distinct antidepressant binding sites. At site 1, [3H]imipramine binding was strictly sodium-dependent with an apparent KD of approximately 10 nM. In contrast, [3H]imipramine binding to site 2 occurred also in the absence of sodium and exhibited a lower affinity. Binding of the nontricyclic antidepressant [3H]citalopram was observed only at site 2. The natural substrate of this carrier, serotonin, competitively inhibited antidepressant binding at both sites; however, its affinity to site 2 was approximately 5-fold lower. These data provide a molecular explanation for the distinct pharmacological actions of different antidepressants.
7562537	Ziprasidone (CP-88,059): a new antipsychotic with combined dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist activity.	Ziprasidone (CP-88,059) is a combined 5-HT (serotonin) and dopamine receptor antagonist which exhibits potent effects in preclinical assays predictive of antipsychotic activity. Whereas the compound is a dopamine antagonist in vitro and in vivo, its most potent action is antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors, where its affinity is an order of magnitude greater than that observed for dopamine D2 sites. Laboratory and clinical findings have led to a hypothesis that antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain limits the undesirable motor side effects associated with dopamine receptor blockade and improves efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ziprasidone possesses an in vitro 5-HT2A/dopamine D2 receptor affinity ratio higher than any clinically available antipsychotic agent. In vivo, ziprasidone antagonizes 5-HT2A receptor-induced head twitch with 6-fold higher potency than for blockade of d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a measure of central dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Ziprasidone also has high affinity for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes, which may further enhance its therapeutic potential. The prediction of antipsychotic efficacy without severe motor side effects is supported by the relatively weak potency of ziprasidone to produce catalepsy in animals, contrasted with its potent antagonism of conditioned avoidance responding and dopamine agonist-induced locomotor activation and stereotypy. The compound is well tolerated in animals at doses producing effective dopamine antagonism in the brain. Ziprasidone should be a valuable addition to the treatment of psychotic disorders.
7585327	Actions of diazoxide on CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices from rats.	Membrane effects of diazoxide (DZX) were examined in CA1 pyramidal neurons, mainly by whole-cell recording in slices kept at 33 degrees C (from Sprague-Dawley rats). Bath applications of DZX (0.65 mM) did not significantly change the resting input conductance; but instantaneous inward rectification was reduced by 47 +/- 14% (near -110 mV). There was a similar depression of a large, sustained voltage-dependent outward current (by 44 +/- 11% near 0 mV). A nearly identical reduction of the outward current recorded in a Ca current suppressing medium (but not in 30 mM tetraethylammonium) indicated that the DZX-sensitive current includes the delayed rectifier. In Mn, low-Ca medium containing tetraethylammonium and carbachol, DZX potentiated (by 43 +/- 12%) the D-type slowly decaying outward current seen after hyperpolarizing pulses at a holding potential of approximately -50 mV. DZX abolished or depressed slow inward currents, such as the tetrodotoxin-sensitive persistent Na current, high voltage activated Ca currents (IC50 = 0.47 mM), and the Q current. In 6 of 13 cells recorded with electrodes containing either guanosine or adenosine diphosphate, DZX potentiated the voltage-dependent outward current, but input conductances were reduced. In conclusion, although there was little indication that it activates classical KATP channels in CA1 neurons, DZX strongly depresses several voltage-dependent, slowly inactivating outward and inward currents, which are important modulators of cell excitability.
7681475	The K+ channel opener diazoxide enhances glutamatergic currents and reduces GABAergic currents in hippocampal neurons.	1. The effect of diazoxide, an opener of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) has been investigated in the rat hippocampal slices by the use of extracellular and intracellular recording techniques. 2. In control solution, diazoxide enhanced the CA1 and CA3 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and produced interictal activities in CA3. These effects were neither prevented by KATP blockers, including glibenclamide (3-30 microM) or tolbutamide (500 microM), nor mimicked by another KATP opener such as galanine (1 microM); thus these effects are probably not mediated by KATP channels. 3. Using intracellular recording, we then studied, in CA3 pyramidal neurons, the effect of diazoxide on the EPSPs and the fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). 4. In presence of bicuculline (10 microM) and phaclofen (50 microM), to block, respectively, fast and slow IPSPs, diazoxide reversibly enhanced the EPSPs. 5. In presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10 microM), to block EPSPs, diazoxide reversibly decreased both fast and slow IPSPs. 6. These effects of diazoxide on the EPSPs and fast and slow IPSPs were associated neither with a change of the reversal potential of the EPSPs or the fast and slow IPSPs nor with a change of the input resistance and membrane potential. 7. Using single electrode voltage-clamp technique, we then tested the effects of diazoxide on the currents generated by applications of glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -A and -B analogues. 8. In presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 microM), diazoxide reversibly enhanced the peak currents evoked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate (AMPA; 3-5 microM), quisqualate (5-10 microM) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 10 microM), but not those evoked by kainate (1-3 microM). 9. In presence of TTX (1 microM), diazoxide reversibly decreased the GABA- (1-5 mM), isoguvacine- (30-60 microM), and baclofen- (10-30 microM) mediated peak currents. 10. It is concluded that, in the hippocampus, diazoxide enhances the excitatory glutamatergic currents and reduces the GABAergic inhibition, thus generating paroxystic activities. We suggest that these effects are mediated by second messenger cascades.
7700252	Biogenic amine flux mediated by cloned transporters stably expressed in cultured cell lines: amphetamine specificity for inhibition and efflux.	LLC-PK1 cells have been stably transfected with cDNAs encoding the human norepinephrine transporter (NET), rat dopamine transporter (DAT), and rat serotonin transporter. Using these cell lines, the specificity of each transporter toward agents that inhibit substrate influx and stimulate substrate efflux across the plasma membrane was examined. With 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium as a substrate for DAT and NET and serotonin as a substrate for the serotonin transporter, each transporter demonstrated a distinct pattern of inhibition by a panel of amphetamine derivatives and analogs, including amphetamine, methamphetamine (also known as "ecstasy"), p-chloroamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylphenidate (ritalin), and 5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindan. For each cell line expressing a single biogenic amine transporter, efflux of the accumulated substrate was stimulated by amphetamine derivatives, and this efflux was blocked by mazindol, an inhibitor of all three transporters. Of the amphetamine derivatives tested, some caused efflux at concentrations similar to those that inhibited transport. Other derivatives were much less effective at stimulating efflux than at inhibiting uptake. Methylphenidate caused little or no efflux, although it blocked uptake mediated by both NET and DAT. Other inhibitors of transport, such as cocaine, mazindol, citalopram, and nisoxetine, failed to stimulate efflux from these cells at concentrations that inhibited influx. The results suggest that potency toward individual plasma membrane biogenic amine transporters and the ability to release accumulated amine substrates are independent properties of each amphetamine derivative.
7750284	Characterization of the novel progestin gestodene by receptor binding studies and transactivation assays.	Gestodene is a novel progestin used in oral contraceptives with an increased separation of progestogenic versus androgenic activity and a distinct antimineralocorticoid activity. This specific pharmacological profile of gestodene is defined by its pattern of binding affinities to a variety of steroid hormone receptors. In the present study the affinity of gestodene to the progesterone receptor (PR), the androgen receptor (AR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the estrogen receptor (ER) was re-evaluated by steroid binding assays and compared to those obtained for 3-keto-desogestrel and progesterone. The two synthetic progestins displayed identical high affinity to rabbit PR and similar marked binding to rat AR and GR, while progesterone showed high affinity to PR but only low binding to AR and GR. Furthermore, 3-keto-desogestrel exhibited almost no binding to MR, whereas gestodene, similar to progesterone, showed marked affinity to this receptor. In addition to receptor binding studies, transactivation assays were carried out to investigate the effects of gestodene on AR-, GR- and MR-mediated induction of transcription. In contrast to progesterone, which showed antiandrogenic activity, gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel both exhibited androgenic activity. Furthermore, all three progestins exhibited weak GR-mediated antagonistic activity. In contrast to progesterone, which showed almost no glucocorticoid activity, gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel showed weak glucocorticoid action. In addition, gestodene inhibited the aldosterone-induced reporter gene transcription, similar to progesterone, whereas unlike progesterone, gestodene did not induce reporter gene transcription. 3-Keto-desogestrel showed neither antimineralocorticoid nor mineralocorticoid action.
7843749	Hemodynamic and biochemical effects of the AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan in hypertension.	We studied the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and biochemical effects of the novel angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist irbesartan in 86 untreated patients with essential hypertension on a normal sodium diet. According to a double-blind parallel group trial, patients were randomized to a once-daily oral dose of the AT1 receptor antagonist (1, 25, or 100 mg) or placebo after a placebo run-in period of 3 weeks. Randomization medication was given for 1 week. Compared with placebo, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure did not change with the 1-mg dose, and it fell (mean and 95% confidence interval) by 7.0 (4.2-9.8)/6.1 (3.9-8.1) mm Hg with the 25-mg dose and by 12.1 (8.1-16.2)/7.2 (4.9-9.4) mm Hg with the 100-mg dose. Heart rate did not change during either dose. With the 25-mg dose, the antihypertensive effect was attenuated during the second half of the recording, and with the 100-mg dose, it was maintained for 24 hours. Baseline values of renin and the antihypertensive response to the 25- and 100-mg doses were well correlated (r = .68, P < .01). Renin did not change with the 1-mg dose, but it rose threefold to fourfold with the 25-mg dose and fourfold to fivefold with the 100-mg dose 4 to 6 hours after administration. With the 100-mg dose, renin was still elevated twofold 24 hours after dosing. The changes in renin induced by the AT1 receptor antagonist were associated with parallel increments in angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Aldosterone, despite AT1 receptor blockade, did not fall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7855217	Binding of antidepressants to human brain receptors: focus on newer generation compounds.	Using radioligand binding assays and post-mortem normal human brain tissue, we obtained equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds) for 17 antidepressants and two of their metabolites at histamine H1, muscarinic, alpha 1-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic, dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT1A, and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Several newer antidepressants were compared with older drugs. In addition, we studied some antimuscarinic, antiparkinson, antihistamine, and neuroleptic compounds at some of these receptors. For the antidepressants, classical tricyclic antidepressants were the most potent drugs at five of the seven receptors (all but alpha 2-adrenergic and 5-HT1A receptors). The chlorophenylpiperazine derivative antidepressants (etoperidone, nefazodone, trazodone) were the most potent antidepressants at alpha 2-adrenergic and 5-HT1A receptors. Of ten antihistamines tested, none was more potent than doxepin at histamine H1 receptors. At muscarinic receptors antidepressants and antihistamines had a range of potencies, which were mostly weaker than those for antimuscarinics. From the in vitro data, we expect adinazolam, bupropion, fluoxetine, sertraline, tomoxetine, and venlafaxine not to block any of these five receptors in vivo. An antidepressant's potency for blocking a specific receptor is predictive of certain side effects and drug-drug interactions. These studies can provide guidelines for the clinician in the choice of antidepressant.
7858879	Role of endogenous endothelin in myocardial and coronary endothelial injury after ischaemia and reperfusion in rats: studies with bosentan, a mixed ETA-ETB antagonist.	1. Previous studies suggested that endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a role in myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion. This study was designed to test the effect of a new nonpeptide antagonist of endothelin ETA and ETB receptors, bosentan, on myocardial infarct size, ventricular arrhythmias, and coronary endothelial dysfunction after ischaemia and reperfusion. 2. Anaesthetized male Wistar rats were subjected to 20 min ischaemia (left coronary artery occlusion) followed by 1 h (for the evaluation of coronary endothelial dysfunction) or 2 h (for the evaluation of infarct size) reperfusion, or 5 min ischaemia followed by 15 min reperfusion (for the evaluation of reperfusion arrhythmias). Vascular studies were performed on 1.5-2 mm coronary segments (internal diameter 250-300 microns) removed distal to the site of occlusion and mounted in wire myographs for isometric tension recording. Area at risk and infarct size were determined by Indian ink injection and triphenyl tetrazolium staining, using computerized analysis of enlarged sections after colour video acquisition. 3. Bosentan, administered at a dose which virtually abolished the pressor response to big ET-1 (3 mg kg-1, i.v. before ischaemia) did not affect heart rate, arterial pressure or the rate pressure product before ischaemia, during ischaemia and during reperfusion. Bosentan did not affect the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (controls: 86%, n = 14; bosentan: 93%, n = 15), and did not modify infarct size (% of area at risk: controls: 63 +/- 4, n = 10; bosentan: 60 +/- 6, n = 8). Ischaemia followed by reperfusion markedly reduced the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine(maximal response: sham: 59 +/- 4%, n = 9; ischaemia-reperfusion: 26+/- 6%, n = 8; P<0.01), characteristic of reperfusion-induced endothelial dysfunction, and this dysfunction was not prevented by bosentan (maximal response to acetylcholine: 25 +/-5%, n = 9; P<0.01 vs sham; P = NS vs ischaemia/reperfusion).4. These experiments suggest that endogenous endothelin does not contribute to myocyte or coronary endothelial injury in this rat model of ischaemia and reperfusion.
7898773	Competitive antagonism of serotonin (5-HT)2C and 5-HT2A receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) turnover by clozapine in the rat: a comparison to other antipsychotics.	The antagonist actions of clozapine and several other antipsychotics at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A and 5-HT2C receptors were studied using the in vitro model of 5-HT-induced phosphoinositide (PI) turnover in rat choroid plexus (5-HT2C) and frontal cortex (5-HT2A). While (-)-sulpiride and raclopride were inactive, clozapine and the other drugs behaved as antagonists both at 5-HT2A and at 5-HT2C receptors. Their order of potency (p Inhibitory Concentration (IC)50) was as follows. 5-HT2A receptors: risperidone (9.07) > spiperone > chlorpromazine > clozapine > thioridazine = fluphenazine > haloperidol (6.03). 5-HT2C receptors: clozapine (7.19) > chlorpromazine > risperidone > thioridazine > fluphenazine > spiperone > haloperidol (< 4.00). In each tissue, clozapine shifted the concentration-effect curve for 5-HT to the right in the absence of an alteration in slope or maximal effect. These findings indicate that clozapine acts as a competitive antagonist at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and that its antagonist properties are shared, though less potently at 5-HT2C sites, by several, clinically active antipsychotics.
7921608	Effects of bosentan (Ro 47-0203), an ETA-, ETB-receptor antagonist, on regional haemodynamic responses to endothelins in conscious rats.	1. Regional haemodynamic responses to endothelin (ET)-1, -2 and -3 and big ET-1 (all at 500 pmol kg-1) were assessed in the same conscious Long Evans rats (n = 8) in the absence or presence of the mixed ETA-, ETB-receptor antagonist, Ro 47-0203 (bosentan; 30 mg kg-1). 2. Bosentan blocked the initial depressor, tachycardic and hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator effects of ET-1, -2 and -3, and substantially curtailed the primary renal and secondary hindquarters vasoconstrictor responses. Bosentan did not inhibit the initial mesenteric vasoconstrictor action of ET-1, but reduced the duration of the later mesenteric vasoconstriction. In contrast, bosentan delayed the rate of onset, and reduced the duration, of the mesenteric vasoconstrictor actions of ET-2 and ET-3. The most likely explanation of this finding is that ET-1, but not ET-2 or ET-3, triggered a covert mesenteric vasodilator mechanism which was antagonized by bosentan. 3. Bosentan blocked all the effects of big ET-1, and, in a separate group of rats (n = 7), blocked all the haemodynamic effects of a lower dose of ET-1 (50 pmol kg-1), with the exception of a slight mesenteric vasoconstriction. 4. The most straightforward explanation of the results is that the major haemodynamic effects of ET-1, -2 and -3, and all the effects of big ET-1, are mediated through ETA- and/or ETB-receptors that are effectively antagonized by bosentan.
7928982	Cloning and sequence analysis of the rpsL and rpsG genes of Mycobacterium smegmatis and characterization of mutations causing resistance to streptomycin.	The Mycobacterium smegmatis rpsL and rpsG genes, encoding the ribosomal proteins S12 and S7, were cloned, and their DNA sequence was determined. The third nucleotide of the S12 termination codon overlapped the first nucleotide of the S7 translation initiation codon. A collection of 28 spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutants of M. smegmatis were isolated. All had single-base-pair substitutions in the rpsL gene which were changed to a streptomycin-sensitive phenotype by complementation with a low-copy-number plasmid carrying the wild-type M. smegmatis rpsL gene. A total of eight different mutations were found in two specific regions of the rpsL gene. Fifty-seven percent (16 of 28) altered the Lys codon at position 43. Forty-six percent of the mutations (13 of 28) were due to a transition changing an AAG Lys codon to an AGG Arg codon, with eight changes at codon 43 and five at codon 88.
7962113	Human Co115 colon carcinoma cells potentiate the degradation of laminin mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator.	The plasminogen activation (PA) system of human Co115 colon carcinoma cells was investigated. Analysis at the levels of protein and mRNA of cultured cells and of histozymography of tumor xenografts in nude mice showed that Co115 cells produce only tissue type PA (t-PA) and no urokinase (u-PA). Also, mRNA for the u-PA receptor and for PA inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), but not for PAI-1, were detected. We developed a quantitative degradation assay using glutaraldehyde-immobilized 125I-laminin to investigate the capacity of Co115 cells to degrade laminin. Laminin degradation by Co115 cells was completely inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml of polyclonal anti-t-PA IgG, by the plasmin inhibitors aprotinin (100 micrograms/ml) or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA; at 0.3 M), but not by antibodies against u-PA or u-PAR nor by nonimmune IgG. Cycloheximide-treated Co115 cells were unable to degrade laminin but increased laminin degradation induced by conditioned medium of Co115 cells or recombinant t-PA. No potentiation was observed when Co115 cells and laminin were kept separated by Transwell inserts. Our results suggest that Co115 human colon carcinoma cells degrade laminin by potentiating t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation at the cell surface which requires close contact between tumor cells and laminin substrate.
8000225	[Effects of gossypol acetate, danazol, progesterone and GnRH-A on estrogen and progesterone receptors of human endometrial cells].	In order to evaluate the drugs in treating endometriosis, the direct effects of gossypol acetate, danazol, progesterone, and gonadotropin releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-A) on the isolated human endometrial cells were determined by DCC assay. The binding capacity of cytosolic estradiol receptor (E2R) and progesterone receptor (PR) in groups treated with gossypol acetate or progesterone decreased. In danazol-treated group, the binding capacity of PR decreased but not that of E2R. GnRH-A showed no significant effect on the binding capacity of E2R and PR. There was a significant linear correlation between the inhibitory rates of PR binding capacity of progesterone and danazol. The results suggested that gossypol acetate, danazol and progesterone might have peripheral effects mediated by steroid receptors, while GnRH-A work clinically through the central path way only.
8003661	Effects of cyclothiazide on synaptic responses in slices of adult and neonatal rat hippocampus.	The effects of cyclothiazide, a drug that blocks AMPA receptor desensitization, on synaptic responses were studied in field CA1 of hippocampal slices from adult and neonatal rats. Cyclothiazide (100 microM) reliably increased AMPA receptor-mediated field EPSP decay times in adult slices but only after prolonged (60-120 min) applications. In neonatal slices, 30 min applications of cyclothiazide were sufficient to produce large and long-lasting increases in response decay times. Since the effects of cyclothiazide on AMPA receptor binding properties were similar in adult and neonatal forebrain membranes, the data indicate that the slow action of the drug in adult slices is probably due to diffusion barriers. The prolongation of EPSP decay by cyclothiazide suggests that AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic responses in hippocampus are terminated by receptor desensitization.
8020989	Localization of the glucagon receptor gene to human chromosome band 17q25.	The gene encoding the human glucagon receptor (GCGR) was mapped to chromosome band 17q25 by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. An Alu variable poly(A) DNA polymorphism was identified in this gene. Studies in the CEPH families showed significant evidence of linkage between DNA polymorphism and markers localized to the distal long arm of chromosome 17.
8070313	Binding of dorzolamide and its metabolite, N-deethylated dorzolamide, to human erythrocytes in vitro.	Dorzolamide, previously known as MK-507, is a novel topical carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor. The uptake and binding of dorzolamide and its N-deethylated metabolite to human erythrocytes were studied in vitro. Dorzolamide and N-deethylated dorzolamide were preferentially taken up by the erythrocytes, and the uptake of dorzolamide by erythrocytes was found to be much faster than that of N-deethylated dorzolamide. When 20 or 200 microM dorzolamide was incubated with human erythrocytes, 98% or 71% of the drug was taken up by the erythrocytes, respectively. Similarly, using 20 or 200 microM N-deethylated dorzolamide, 99.7% or 75% of the drug was taken up by the erythrocytes, respectively. These results indicate that human erythrocytes contain proteins that bind to dorzolamide and N-deethylated dorzolamide, and the binding of these proteins is saturable. The results of the in vitro binding study suggest that presence of at least three kinds of binding site for dorzolamide in human erythrocytes. One of the binding sites for dorzolamide was characterized by extremely high affinity (Kd = 0.0011 microM) and low capacity (Bmax = 16.1 microM), corresponding to CA-II. Another binding site was characterized by low affinity (Kd = 2.8 microM) and high capacity (Bmax = 117.1 microM), corresponding to CA-I. The third one was a nonspecific binding. The binding of N-deethylated dorzolamide to human CA-I and CA-II was competitively inhibited by dorzolamide, indicating that these compounds bind to the same binding site on CAs. In each other's presence, most of dorzolamide in erythrocytes binds to CA-II, whereas the N-deethylated metabolite mainly binds to CA-I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8081071	Involvement of muscarinic M2 and M3, but not of M1 and M4 receptors in vagally stimulated contractions of rabbit bronchus/trachea.	The inhibition of preganglionic and postganglionic contractions of the rabbit isolated bronchus/trachea by antagonists with selectivity for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was compared with their affinities at M1, M2, M3 and M4 receptors. Neither M1/M3 receptor-unselective antagonists (atropine, hexahydro-siladifenidol, thiazinamium, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol) nor antagonists with selectivity for the M1 over M3 subtype ((+)-biperiden, UH-AH 37, telenzepine, o-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium, pirenzepine) consistently showed a preferential inhibition of the response to preganglionic over postganglionic stimulation. Potencies for inhibition of contraction to preganglionic stimulation by antagonists discriminating more than threefold both between M1 and M3, and between M3 and M2 receptors (hexocyclium, (+)-biperiden, UH-AH 37, telenzepine, o-methoxy-silahexocyclium, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol, pirenzepine) are most consistent with affinities at smooth muscle M3 receptors as determined on methacholine-contracted rabbit trachea. Antagonists with a 10-fold higher affinity at M2 over M3 receptors enhanced contractions to field stimulation (AQ-RA 741 = AF-DX 384 = idaverine > himbacine = imperialine = AF-DX 116 = methoctramine > gallamine), whereas antagonists with a selectivity profile of M4 > or = M3 > M2 (hexahydro-sila-difenidol, pirenzepine, dicyclomine) failed to increase the contractions. Secoverine (selectivity profile M4 > M2 > M3) enhanced contractions at concentrations consistent with its M2 receptor affinity. These results (1) exclude a ganglionic M1 receptor modulating excitatory vagal neurotransmission but (2) suggest the presence of an inhibitory prejunctional M2 rather than an M4 receptor and (3) identify a postjunctional smooth muscle M3 receptor in rabbit bronchus/trachea.
8098761	In vivo microdialysis evidence for central serotonin1A and serotonin1B autoreceptor blocking properties of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist (-)penbutolol.	Recently, we found that the beta 1/beta 2 adrenoceptor blocking agent (-)penbutolol prevents behavioral and biochemical actions of the specific serotonin (5-HT)1A agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. The putative 5-HT1 receptor antagonist profile of (-)penbutolol was further explored in the present study, using in vivo microdialysis methods to assess its effects on central 5-HT release. (+)Penbutolol and (-)pindolol were included for comparison purposes. In contrast to (-)pindolol (8.0 mg/kg s.c.), administration of (-)penbutolol (2.0 or 8.0 mg/kg s.c.) increased hippocampal 5-HT output. The (-)penbutolol-induced 5-HT response was dose-related, stereoselective and Ca(++)-dependent. In addition, the 5-HT response to (-)penbutolol was abolished by omitting the 5-HT reuptake blocker citalopram from the perfusion medium, suggesting the need for endogenous 5-HT tone. Local (-)penbutolol (1 microM) perfusion increased the 5-HT output per se, and also blocked 5-HT release suppression caused by the 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP-93,129. Furthermore, (-)penbutolol, but not its (+)antipode, prevented the decrease of 5-HT release induced by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. By comparison, the 5-HT1 receptor inactive beta adrenoceptor blockers metoprolol (beta 1) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2), given alone or in combination, did not increase 5-HT output and were ineffective in antagonizing the (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin response. The data indicate that (-)penbutolol possesses 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonist properties, and may be a useful tool in studies of central 5-HT receptor-mediated function.
8144028	The human glucagon receptor encoding gene: structure, cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization.	Characterization of the human glucagon-receptor-encoding gene (GGR) should provide a greater understanding of blood glucose regulation and may reveal a genetic basis for the pathogenesis of diabetes. A cDNA encoding a complete functional human glucagon receptor (GGR) was isolated from a liver cDNA library by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and colony hybridization. The cDNA encodes a receptor protein with 80% identity to rat GGR that binds [125I]glucagon and transduces a signal leading to increases in the concentration of intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Southern blot analysis of human DNA reveals a hybridization pattern consistent with a single GGR locus. In situ hybridization to metaphase chromosome preparations maps the GGR locus to chromosome 17q25. Analysis of the genomic sequence shows that the coding region spans over 5.5 kb and is interrupted by 12 introns.
8182534	Cholecystokinin-related peptides, after systemic or central administration, prevent carbon monoxide-induced amnesia in mice.	The neuroprotective actions of cholecystokinin (CCK) peptides were investigated in a mouse hypoxia model, in which the animals were successively exposed to CO gas. Working memory impairment 5 days after CO exposure was examined by using a Y-maze test; delayed amnesia was examined 7 days after CO exposure, by using a step-down type passive avoidance test. Ceruletide (1-100 micrograms/kg, given s.c. 30 min before CO exposure) significantly prevented the CO-induced impairment of performance in both tests, the improvement being correlated with the severity of hypoxia. This severity was increased by maintaining the body temperature at 38 degrees C. Ceruletide was less effective when injected immediately after a single CO exposure. The order of potency of the CCK-peptides administered systemically was: ceruletide > CCK-8S > CCK-8NS > CCK-4. Ceruletide (0.03-0.3 micrograms/mouse) and CCK-8S (0.03-1 microgram/mouse) prevented CO-induced amnesia after i.c.v. administration. Under all experimental conditions, dizocilpine [MK-801, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate, 500 micrograms/kg s.c. or 10 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.] prevented completely the CO-induced amnesia. The protective effects of systemic ceruletide were blocked, partially but significantly, by the preadministration of L-364,718 (3S-(-)-N-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-S-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide, 1-10 mg/kg i.p.), a selective CCK-A receptor antagonist. L-365,260 ([3R-(+)-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl] -N' - [3-methyl-phenyl]urea), a CCK-B antagonist, also decreased ceruletide-induced protection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8242249	Pharmacological profile of valsartan: a potent, orally active, nonpeptide antagonist of the angiotensin II AT1-receptor subtype.	1. The pharmacological profile of valsartan, (S)-N-valeryl-N-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]-methyl)-vali ne, a potent, highly selective, and orally active antagonist at the angiotensin II (AII) AT1-receptor, was studied in vitro and in vivo. 2. Valsartan competed with [125I]-AII at its specific binding sites in rat aortic smooth muscle cell membranes (AT1-receptor subtype) with a Ki of 2.38 nM, but was about 30,000 times less active in human myometrial membranes (AT2-receptor subtype). 3. In rabbit aortic rings incubated for 5 min with valsartan, at concentrations of 2, 20 and 200 nM, the concentration-response curve of AII was displaced to the right and the maximum response was reduced by 33%, 36% and 40%, respectively. Prolongation of the incubation time with valsartan to 1 h or 3 h, further reduced the maximum response by 48% or 59% (after 20 nM) and by 59% or 60% (after 200 nM) respectively. After 3 h incubation an apparent pKb value of 9.26 was calculated. Contractions induced by noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or potassium chloride were not affected by valsartan. No agonistic effects were observed in the rabbit aorta at concentrations of valsartan up to 2 microM. 4. In bovine adrenal glomerulosa, valsartan inhibited AII-stimulated aldosterone release without affecting the maximum response (pA2 8.4). 5. In the pithed rat, oral administration of valsartan (10 mg kg-1) shifted the AII-induced pressor response curves to the right, without affecting responses induced by the electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow or by noradrenaline. Animals treated with valsartan 24 h before pithing also showed significant inhibition of the response to AII. 6. In conscious, two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K1C), valsartan decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after single i.v. or oral administration. The respective ED30 values were 0.06 mg kg-1 (i.v.) and 1.4 mg kg-1 (p.o.). The antihypertensive effect lasted for at least 24 h after either route of administration. After repeated oral administration for 4 days (3 and 10 mg kg-1 daily), in 2K1C renal hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure was consistently decreased, but heart rate was not significantly affected. 7. In conscious, normotensive, sodium-depleted marmosets, valsartan decreased mean arterial pressure, measured by telemetry, after oral doses of 1-30 mg kg-1. The hypotensive effect persisted up to 12 h after 3 and 10 mg kg-1 and up to 24 h after 30 mg kg-1. 8. In sodium-depleted marmosets, the hypotensive effect of valsartan lasted longer than that of losartan(DuP 753). In renal hypertensive rats, both agents had a similar duration (24 h), but a different onset of action (valsartan at 1 h, losartan between 2 h and 24 h).9. These results demonstrate that valsartan is a potent, specific, highly selective antagonist of AII at theAT1-receptor subtype and does not possess agonistic activity. Furthermore, it is an efficacious, orally active, blood pressure-lowering agent in conscious renal hypertensive rats and in conscious normotensive,sodium-depleted primates.
8298083	Diazoxide suppresses slowly-inactivating outward and inward currents in CA1 hippocampal neurones.	Diazoxide (DZX) opens ATP-sensitive K (KATP) channels in muscle and other cells. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in slices, in the presence of kynurenate and bicuculline to minimize indirect effects, DZX (0.65 mM) did not increase input conductance; but it sharply reduced persistent inward and outward currents. An inward current (peak near -20 mV) was especially clear in the presence of K channel blockers; was fully evident in Ca-channel blocking medium; but was abolished by tetrodotoxin. The main direct effects of DZX on these neurones are thus mediated not by activation of KATP channels, but rather by modulation of voltage-dependent channels, including a TTX-sensitive persistent NA current and possibly a Ca current.
8392199	Role of the inhibitory adrenergic alpha 2 and serotonergic 5-HT1A components of cocaine's actions on the DOI-induced head-twitch response in 5-HT2-receptor supersensitive mice.	It was recently reported that acute cocaine pretreatment can reduce the (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI)-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2)-receptor mediated head-twitch response (HTR) in mice via indirect stimulation of adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A-receptors. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether cocaine can alter the DOI-induced HTR in 5-HT2-receptor supersensitive mice. Supersensitivity was induced by a single injection of DOI 48 h prior to experimentation. These supersensitive mice exhibited a greater frequency of HTR to a challenge dose of DOI 48 h after its initial administration. Cocaine pretreatment dose-dependently reduced the DOI-induced HTR in the supersensitive mice. The stimulant was approximately four times more potent in the 5-HT2-receptor supersensitive mice relative to its reported effects in normal mice. Receptor blockade studies with yohimbine and alprenolol revealed that both of the inhibitory components of cocaine's actions (i.e., adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A-receptor effects, respectively) were more efficient in reducing the DOI-induced HTR in supersensitive mice compared to normosensitive animals. The present results further support the previously suggested hypothesis that acute cocaine administration inhibits the 5-HT2-receptor function by increasing the synaptic concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin via inhibition of their uptake and therefore indirectly stimulating the respective inhibitory adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A-receptors.
8513851	Pharmacokinetics of temocapril, an ACE inhibitor with preferential biliary excretion, in patients with impaired liver function.	Six subjects with normal liver function (Group 1) and 7 patients with liver dysfunction (Group 2; mean ICGR15 value 30.5 (5.2)%; range 16 to 56) received a single oral dose of 1 mg temocapril, a prodrug-type ACE inhibitor, with preferentially excreted by the biliary route. The plasma temocapril concentrations in Group 2 at 30 min and 1 h postdose were significantly higher than in Group 1, but the difference had disappeared 2 h postdosing. Although the half life of temocapril diacid in Group 2 was significantly longer than in Group 1, there was no significant difference between the two groups in AUC, Cmax or tmax. In Group 2, urinary recovery of temocapril was significantly increased, suggesting a possible delay in the bioactivation of temocapril into the diacid, but recovery of the diacid itself was not abnormal. ACE inhibitory action in Group 2 remained unchanged. Temocapril is regarded as an ACE inhibitor the disposition and efficacy of which are little affected in patients with impaired liver function.
8521855	2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cladribine) and its analogues are good substrates and potent selective inhibitors of Escherichia coli purine-nucleoside phosphorylase.	2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CldAdo), a nucleoside that has proven useful in the treatment of several chronic lymphoid malignancies, and its analogue, 2-bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (Escherichia coli) purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), with Ki values of 4.5 microM and 6.3 microM, respectively. The examination of a series of base-modified analogues of CldAdo has shown that several other compounds have similar inhibitor properties, and has indicated that 6-benzyloxy-2-chloro-9-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)purine is the most potent inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.5 microM, competitive with respect to inosine (Ino). CldAdo itself and its base-modified analogues, discounting those substituted at C(8), are also substrates for the E. coli PNP and undergo rapid glycosidic bond cleavage. CldAdo is degraded with substrate efficiency, i.e. Vmax/Km similar to that observed for Ino (130%), although the individual kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, are both approximately an order of magnitude lower than for Ino. All compounds tested are totally inactive as substrates and inhibitors for mammalian (calf spleen) PNP and therefore constitute a new class of potent selective, although cleavable, inhibitors of bacterial phosphorylases. 8-Bromo-2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine and 8-thio-2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine are the only base-modified CldAdo derivatives showing inhibitory activity against MOLT-3 (acute T-cell leukemia) and U-937 (histiocytic lymphoma) cells and, as shown in this study, are resistant to degradation by E. coli PNP. The above-mentioned results suggest that both analogues could be effective as oral cytotoxic agents that are noncleavable by enteric bacteria.
8566109	Etodolac selectively inhibits human prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PGHS-2) versus human PGHS-1.	The isozymes of prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGHS) are shown to be differentially inhibited in vitro by currently marketed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) using microsomal rhPGHS-1 and rhPGHS-2. Comparison of selectivity ratios (IC50 rhPGHS-1/IC50 rhPGHS-2) demonstrated a 10-fold selectivity of etodolac (Lodine) for rhPGHS-2, whereas the other NSAIDs evaluated demonstrated no preference or a slight preference for inhibition of rhPGHS-1. In vitro enzyme results were supported by a human whole blood assay where etodolac also demonstrated a 10-fold selectivity for inhibition of PGHS-2 mediated TxB2 production. Taken together, these data may be key to explaining the clinically observed gastrointestinal safety of etodolac versus other marketed NSAIDs.
8576220	Mimosine targets serine hydroxymethyltransferase.	The plant amino acid, mimosine, is an extremely effective inhibitor of DNA replication in mammalian cells (Mosca, P. J., Dijkwel, P. A., and Hamlin, J. L. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 4375-4383). Mimosine appears to prevent the formation of replication forks at early-firing origins when delivered to mammalian cells approaching the G1/S boundary, and blocks DNA replication when added to S phase cells after a lag of approximately 2.5 h. We have shown previously that [3H]mimosine can be specifically photocross-linked both in vivo and in vitro to a 50-kDa polypeptide (p50) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In the present study, six tryptic peptides (58 residues total) from p50 were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and their sequences were found to be at least 77.5% identical and 96.5% similar to sequences in rabbit mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mSHMT). This assignment was verified by precipitating the [3H]mimosine-p50 complex with a polyclonal antibody to rabbit cSHMT. The 50-kDa cross-linked product was almost undetectable in a mimosine-resistant CHO cell line and in a CHO gly- cell line that lacks mitochondrial, but not cytosolic, SHMT activity. The gly- cell line is still sensitive to mimosine, suggesting that the drug may inhibit both the mitochondrial and the cytosolic forms. SHMT is involved in the penultimate step of thymidylate biosynthesis in mammalian cells and, as such, is a potential target for chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer.
8577935	Binding of valsartan to mammalian angiotensin AT1 receptors.	The binding characteristics of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan were investigated in different animal species and tissues. Using [125I](Sar1,Ile8) angiotensin II as radioligand, affinity constants were determined in liver and adrenal rat and marmoset, human adrenal and in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. In all tissues tested, valsartan had a greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than losartan (on average 5-fold). The affinities of both antagonists were up to 30 times weaker in the dog tissues [3H]Valsartan bound with high affinity (Kd 1.44 nmol/l) to the rat aortic smooth muscle cell AT1 receptor. Binding was saturable and reversible. Non-specific binding was low (10%). Reports that [3H]losartan binds to a non-angiotensin II binding site in rat liver and in other tissues could be confirmed. [3H]Valsartan on the other hand bound only to the AT1 receptor. Using a competition binding assay with [3H]losartan on rat liver membranes it could be shown that valsartan can bind to the 'losartan binding site', but at a 10,000-fold less affinity than for the AT1 receptor. Valsartan is therefore a highly specific and selective antagonist of the AT1 receptor. Due to its high affinity and low non-specific binding it is a suitable radioactive antagonist for the study of the distribution and function of the angiotensin AT1 receptor.
8605869	TWIK-1, a ubiquitous human weakly inward rectifying K+ channel with a novel structure.	A new human weakly inward rectifying K+ channel, TWIK-1, has been isolated. This channel is 336 amino acids long and has four transmembrane domains. Unlike other mammalian K+ channels, it contains two pore-forming regions called P domains. Genes encoding structural homologues are present in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans. TWIK-1 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes are time-independent and present a nearly linear I-V relationship that saturated for depolarizations positive to O mV in the presence of internal Mg2+. This inward rectification is abolished in the absence of internal Mg2+. TWIK-1 has a unitary conductance of 34 pS and a kinetic behaviour that is dependent on the membrane potential. In the presence of internal Mg2+, the mean open times are 0.3 and 1.9 ms at -80 and +80 mV, respectively. The channel activity is up-regulated by activation of protein kinase C and down-regulated by internal acidification. Both types of regulation are indirect. TWIK-1 channel activity is blocked by Ba2+(IC50=100 microM), quinine (IC50=50 microM) and quinidine (IC50=95 microM). This channel is of particular interest because its mRNA is widely distributed in human tissues, and is particularly abundant in brain and heart. TWIK-1 channels are probably involved in the control of background K+ membrane conductances.
8609227	Epinephrine inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha and potentiates interleukin 10 production during human endotoxemia.	Short-term preexposure of mononuclear cells to epinephrine inhibits LPS-induced production of TNF, whereas preexposure for 24 h results in increased TNF production. To assess the effects of epinephrine infusions of varying duration on in vivo responses to LPS, the following experiments were performed: (a) Blood obtained from eight subjects at 4-24 h after the start of a 24-h infusion of epinephrine (30 ng/kg per min) produced less TNF after ex vivo stimulation with LPS compared with blood drawn before the start of the infusion, and (b) 17 healthy men who were receiving a continuous infusion of epinephrine (30 ng/kg per min) started either 3 h (EPI-3; n = 5) or 24 h (EPI-24; n = 6) were studied after intravenous injection of LPS (2 ng/kg, lot EC-5). EPI-3 inhibited LPS-induced in vivo TNF appearance and also increased IL-10 release (both P < 0.005 versus LPS), whereas EPI-24 only attenuated TNF secretion (P = 0.05). In separate in vitro experiments in whole blood, epinephrine increased LPS-induced IL-10 release by a combined effect on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Further, in LPS-stimulated blood, the increase on IL-10 levels caused by epinephrine only marginally contributed to concurrent inhibition of TNF production. Epinephrine, either endogenously produced or administered as a component of sepsis treatment, may have a net antiinflammatory effect on the cytokine network early in the course of systemic infection.
8610169	Protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity regulates osteoclast formation and function: inhibition by alendronate.	Alendronate (ALN), an aminobisphosphonate used in the treatment of osteoporosis, is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. Its molecular target is still unknown. This study examines the effects of ALN on the activity of osteoclast protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP; protein-tyrosine-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.48), called PTPepsilon. Using osteoclast-like cells generated by coculturing mouse bone marrow cells with mouse calvaria osteoblasts, we found by molecular cloning and RNA blot hybridization that PTPepsilon is highly expressed in osteoclastic cells. A purified fusion protein of PTPepsilon expressed in bacteria was inhibited by ALN with an IC50 of 2 microM. Other PTP inhibitors--orthovanadate and phenylarsine oxide (PAO)-inhibited PTPepsilon with IC50 values of 0.3 microM and 18 microM, respectively. ALN and another bisphosphonate, etidronate, also inhibited the activities of other bacterially expressed PTPs such as PTPsigma and CD45 (also called leukocyte common antigen). The PTP inhibitors ALN, orthovanadate, and PAO suppressed in vitro formation of multinucleated osteoclasts from osteoclast precursors and in vitro bone resorption by isolated rat osteoclasts (pit formation) with estimated IC50 values of 10 microM, 3 microM, and 0.05 microM, respectively. These findings suggest that tyrosine phosphatase activity plays an important role in osteoclast formation and function and is a putative molecular target of bisphosphonate action.
8612523	Postreceptor signalling of growth hormone and prolactin and their effects in the differentiated insulin-secreting cell line, INS-1.	Signal transduction of two mitogens for pancreatic beta-cells, GH and PRL, was investigated using the differentiated insulin-secreting cell line, INS-1. Addition of human GH (hGH) or ovine PRL in a serum-substitute medium increased growth, insulin content, and nutrient metabolism evaluated by tetrazolium salt reduction. hGH, bovine GH (bGH), and PRL also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner (1 pM - 1 nM). hGH induced cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) rises, which were transient, dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, blocked by verapamil, calciseptine, and the hyperpolarizing agent diazoxide, suggesting that hGH stimulates Ca(2+)-influx through L-type Ca(2+)-channels. Similar effects on [Ca2+]i were observed with bGH or PRL. hGH caused membrane depolarization in a small proportion of the cells ( < 25%) as detected by cell-attached patch-clamp analysis. However, hGH failed to stimulate acute insulin secretion. hGH, bGH, and PRL promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase. Verapamil inhibited neither [3H]thymidine incorporation nor JAK2 phosphorylation stimulated by hGH, whereas a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lavendustin A, blocked the mitogenic effect. Involvement of cAMP is suggested because Rp-cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphorothioate, a competitive inhibitor of protein kinase A, abolished hGH-induced [Ca2+]i rises and DNA synthesis. cAMP appears to play a permissive role, although hGH failed to raise cellular cAMP levels. These results support the idea that activation of JAK2 is a major signaling event, whereas the [CA2+]i rise is not a prerequisite, for the mitogenic effects of GH and PRL in insulin-secreting cells.
8615854	Effects of decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate, a novel AMPA receptor antagonist, on glutamate-induced CA2+ responses and neurotoxicity in rat cortical and cerebellar granule neurons.	In this study, we examined the effects of a novel water-soluble, putative AMPA receptor antagonist, (-)(3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3, 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate (LY326325), on glutamate-, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-, and kainic acid (KA)-induced elevations of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and 45Ca2+ uptake, as well as glutamate agonist-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of intact rat cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. In some experiments, the actions of LY326325 were tested in the presence of cyclothiazide, a compound that is known to block glutamate-induced desensitization of AMPA-preferring subtypes of glutamate receptors, thereby largely potentiating the functional effects of AMPA. LY326325 fully blocked the elevations of [Ca2+]i induced by NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor agonists in both cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. The application of increasing concentrations of cyclothiazide was not able to reverse the LY326325-induced blockade of glutamate receptors in cortical neurons. In contrast, the same cyclothiazide treatment fully reversed the blockade produced by the noncompetitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine HCl (GYKI 52466). In 45Ca2+ uptake studies. LY325325 inhibited the NMDA-, AMPA-, and KA-induced enhancement of 45Ca2+ uptake in a concentration-dependent fashion in both cortical and cerebellar granule cells. In analogy to the results obtained with [Ca2+]i recordings, cyclothiazide failed to counteract the LY326325-induced blockade of KA-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake in cerebellar granule neurons, whereas the blockade induced by the noncompetitive AMPA/KA receptor blocking agent GYKI 52466 was fully reversed by cyclothiazide. Because a similar, although not identical pattern of actions was seen following the application of the competitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist 6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline-2-3-dione (NBQX), it is suggested that the inhibitory actions of LY326325 are similar to those produced by NBQX but clearly differ from those caused by the noncompetitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466. Finally, when the neuroprotective actions of LY326325 on glutamate agonist-induced neurotoxicity were examined in cerebellar granule neurons, we found that LY326325 almost completely blocked the neurotoxic actions of NMDA, AMPA, and KA, respectively, whereas it produced only a partial blockade of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, our current results suggest that although LY326325 blocked both nonNMDA and NMDA-induced Ca2+ responses, it still displayed a preferential affinity of nonNMDA receptors as compared to NMDA receptors. However, LY326325 appears to be a less selective AMPA/KA receptor antagonist than NBQX and GYKI52466, respectively.
8622623	5-Carboxamido-tryptamine, CP-122,288 and dihydroergotamine but not sumatriptan, CP-93,129, and serotonin-5-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl -tyrosinamide block dural plasma protein extravasation in knockout mice that lack 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptors.	We studied the dural plasma protein extravasation response after unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in mice lacking serotonin 5-HT1B (5-HT1D beta) receptors by modifying a technique previously described in rats or guinea pigs. We investigated the inhibitory effects of six 5-HT1 receptor agonists in this model: 3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one (CP-93,129), sumatriptan, serotonin-5-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl -tyrosinamide (GTI), 5-methylaminosulfonylmethyl-3-(N-methylpyrrolidin-2R -ylmethyl)-1H-indole (CP-122,288), 5-carboxamido-tryptamine (5-CT), and dihydroergotamine. The plasma extravasation response did not differ between wild-type and mutant after vehicle injection. The potency of sumatriptan, CP-122,288, CP-93,129, and 5-CT in wild-type mice was similar to that previously reported for rats. CP-122,288 (1 nmol kg), 5-CT (1 nmol/kg), and dihydroergotamine (72 nmol/kg) inhibited plasma protein extravasation within dura mater after electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation in both wild-type and knockout mice, which suggests that these agonists act predominantly via receptors other than 5-HT1B. Unlike the wild-type mice, CP-93,129 (1.4 mumol/kg), a specific 5-HT1B receptor agonist, had no effect in knockout mice. The same held true for sumatriptan (0.7 mumol/kg) and GTI (0.6 mumol/kg). These results suggest that CP-93,129, sumatriptan, and GTI exert their effects via 5-HT1B (5-HT1D beta) receptors in mice.
8652509	Synthesis and use of iodinated nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug analogs as crystallographic probes of the prostaglandin H2 synthase cyclooxygenase active site.	The cyclooxygenase activity of the membrane protein prostaglandin H2 synthase isoform 1 (PGHS-1) is the target of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The X-ray crystal structures of PGHS-1 in complex with the NSAIDs flurbiprofen and bromoaspirin have been determined previously [Picot, D., et al. (1994) Nature 367, 243-249; Loll, P. J., et al. (1995) Nat. Struct. Biol. 2, 637-643]. We report here the preparation and characterization of novel potent iodinated analogs of the NSAIDs indomethacin and suprofen, as well as the refined X-ray crystal structures of their complexes with PGHS-1. The PGHS-iodosuprofen complex structure has been refined at 3.5 A to an R-value of 0.189 and shows the suprofen analog to share a common mode of binding with flurbiprofen. The PGHS-iodoindomethacin complex structure has been refined at 4.5 A to an R-value of 0.254. The low resolution of the iodoindomethacin complex structure precludes detailed modeling of drug-enzyme interactions, but the electron-dense iodine atom of the inhibitor has been unambiguously located, allowing for the placement and approximate orientation of the inhibitor in the enzyme's active site. We have modeled two equally likely binding modes for iodoindomethacin, corresponding to the two principal conformers of the inhibitor. Like flurbiprofen, iodosuprofen and iodoindomethacin bind at the end of the long channel which leads into the enzyme active site. Binding at this site presumably blocks access of substrate to Tyr-385, a residue essential for catalysis. No evidence is seen for significant protein conformational differences between the iodoindomethacin and iodosuprofen of flurbiprofen complex structures.
8657204	A novel positive detection system of in vivo mutations in rpsL (strA) transgenic mice.	To positively detect the in vivo mutations accumulated in different mouse organs, we have developed a transgenic mouse system. This transgenic mouse carried an Escherichia coli (E. coli) plasmid pML4 as a shuttle vector that consisted of a replication origin (ori), the kanamycin-resistant gene (KanR) and the rpsL+ gene (strAS) derived from E. coli. These E. coli elements were expected to be inert in the transgenic mouse system; thus, neutral mutations would be accumulated on the shuttle plasmid in the transgenic mice. The shuttle plasmid vector was recovered from the mouse genomic DNA and introduced into kanamycin-sensitive (KmS) and streptomycin-resistant (SmR) E. coli cells by using electroporation. The original pML4 shuttle plasmid transformed the host E. coli to KmR and SmS, since both the KanR and rpsL genes exhibited dominant traits of KmR and SmS, respectively. On the other hand, when the retrieved pML4 shuttle plasmid carried a mutated rpsL gene, it could be positively detected as both KmR and SmR. Based on this principle, we were able to positively detect the in vivo mutations accumulated in the rpsL transgene of the shuttle vector pML4 integrated into the mouse genome. The total number of rescued shuttle plasmids were counted on the plates containing Km alone, while only mutants were detected on the plates containing both Km and Sm. We have so far established 22 independent transgenic mouse lines that carried up to approx. 750 copies of the shuttle plasmid pML4 in a haploid genome. By using high-copy-number transgenic mouse lines which carried 350 copies or more of the shuttle vector, we also developed a simple and proficient method for retrieving the shuttle plasmid from various tissues of the transgenic mice. The background mutant frequency was approx. 5 x 10(-5). In order to validate the applicability of the positive-detection transgenic system for the induced mutagenicity assay, methylnitrosourea (MNU) was administered to the transgenic mice, and an increase in the number of mutant frequencies was seen in all tested organs including spleen, liver and brain. The rpsL transgenic mouse system was therefore considered to provide a quick-and-easy risk assessment test for in vivo tissue-specific mutagenicity, using positive detection by streptomycin.
8664284	Characterization of a Cys115 to Asp substitution in the Escherichia coli cell wall biosynthetic enzyme UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) that confers resistance to inactivation by the antibiotic fosfomycin.	The antibiotic fosfomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inactivation of UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvyl tranferase (MurA). Prior work has established that Cys115 of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae MurA is the active site nucleophile alkylated by fosfomycin and implicated this residue in the formation of a covalent phospholactyl-enzyme adduct derived from substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). On the basis of sequencing information from putative MurA homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we generated a C115D mutant of E. coli MurA that was highly active but fully resistant to time-dependent inhibition by fosfomycin. Fosfomycin still bound to the active site of C115D MurA, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition by fosfomycin. Fosfomycin still bound to the active site of C115D MurA, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition vs PEP. In contrast to the broad pH-independent behavior of wild-type (WT) MurA, C115D mutant activity titrated across the pH range examined (pH 5.5-9) with an apparent pKa approximately 6, with kcatC115D ranging from approximately 10kcatWT at pH 5.5 to <0.1kcatWT at pH9.0. Km(PEP)115D was relatively constant in the pH range examined and increased approximately 100-fold relative to Km(PEP)WT. A fosfomycin-resistant C115E mutant with -1% activity of the C115D mutant was found to follow a pH dependence similar to that observed for C115D MurA. The contrasting pH dependences of WT and C115D MurA was also observed in the reaction with the pseudosubstrate, (Z)-3-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate, strongly suggesting a role for Cys/Asp115 as the general acid in the protonation of C-3 of PEP during MurA-catalyzed enol ether transfer. The difference in nucleophilicity between the carboxylate side chains of Asp115 and Glu115 and the thiolate group of Cys115 suggests that covalent enzyme adduct formation is not required for catalytic turnover and, furthermore, provides a chemical rationale for the resistance of the C115D and C115E mutants to fosfomycin inactivation.
8700146	Mapping the block of a cloned human inward rectifier potassium channel by dofetilide.	Dofetilide, a methanesulfonanilide derivative, is a potent class III antiarrhythmic drug. Like other members of this class of K+ channel blockers, the sites in the channel to which the drug binds are unknown, although high and low affinity binding has been reported in cardiomyocytes. The most sensitive K+ channel target for dofetilide seems to be IKr, the rapid component of the repolarizing delayed rectifier K+ current. However, block of other K+ channels occurs at higher concentrations and is of special interest in regard to toxicity. Recently, we have demonstrated that hIRK, a cloned inward rectifier K+ channel (IRK) isolated from human atrium and expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes, is blocked by dofetilide. We report the localization of a site that is critical for dofetilide block in hIRK. We used chimeric constructs between hIRK and ROMK1, a related inward rectifier that is drug resistant. Substitution of hIRK-M2, the second putative transmembrane spanning segment of IRKs, with ROMK1-M2 increased unblocking of dofetilide by 10-20-fold in hIRK. Site-directed mutagenesis further pinpointed the effects to a single hydrophobic residue (I177) in M2. A reduction in hydrophobicity by the point mutation I177C increased recovery from block > 10-fold (1.17 sec in wild-type to 0.112 sec at -80 mV at physiological K+ concentrations), leading us to suggest that hydrophobic interactions are essential for dofetilide block in hIRK. A similar mechanism may explain dofetilide block in other ion channels, including IKr.
8737748	Human whole blood assays for inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthases-1 and -2 using A23187 and lipopolysaccharide stimulation of thromboxane B2 production.	When freshly drawn, heparinized human whole blood is incubated with 50 microM calcium ionophore A23187, platelets are stimulated to produce thromboxane B2 (TxB2) by activation of prostaglandin G/H synthase-l (PGHS-1). TxB2 concentration, as measured by immunoassay, is maximal at 20-30 min and declines thereafter. Addition of acetylsalicylic acid (IC50 = 2.8 microM) or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 15 min or 4.5h prior to 30 min stimulation with ionophore results in concentration dependent inhibition of TxB2 production. When blood is incubated with 0.01-10 micrograms/ml E. colilipopolysaccharide (LPS), PGHS-2 is induced and TxB2 levels become detectable at 3h and continue to increase through 24h. Using a 5h incubation with 10 micrograms/ml LPS, aspirin (10 microM added at 0 h), which is rapidly metabolized to salicylic acid, had no effect on 10 micrograms/ml LPS-induced TxB2, but inhibited TxB2 production by ionophore A23187 added at 4.5h through acetylation of pre-existing PGHS-1. In a 5h assay, NSAIDs added at 0 h were compared for inhibition of TxB2 production stimulated by addition of ionophore A23187 at 4.5h (PGHS-1), or by addition of LPS at 0 h (PGHS-2). Most NSAIDs were more potent against PGHS-1 than PGHS-2. Diclofenac, naproxen and flufenamic acid were equipotent or slightly selective for PGHS-2. Diflunisal and nimesulide were > 4-fold selective for PGHS-2, and NS-398 was > 30-fold selective for PGHS-2.
8741180	Selective antagonism of human 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptor-mediated responses in stably transfected C6-glial cells by ketanserin and GR 127,935.	The antagonist effects of ketanserin and 2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4)oxadiazol-3-yl)-biphenyl-[4-carboxyli c acid 4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-phenyl]-amide (GR 127,935) were compared to naratriptan-induced inhibition of cAMP formation in C6-glial cell lines stably expressing human 5-HT1D or 5-HT1B receptor sites. Ketanserin demonstrated potent (pA2: 7.76), competitive antagonism of naratriptan-induced inhibition of forskolin (100 microM)-stimulated cAMP formation in C6-glial/5-HT1D cells. Whereas GR 127,935 was ineffective as an antagonist in these cells, it produced and intrinsic activity (pEC50: 6.98) that was sensitive to ketanserin (10 microM) blockade. Unlike ketanserin, GR 127,935 potently antagonised the naratriptan response in C6-glial/5-HT1B cells while also depressing the maximum response. The differential antagonist effects of ketanserin and GR 127,935 on naratriptan responses elicited in C6-glial/5-HT1D and C6-glial/5-HT1B cells demonstrate these compounds do selectively block human 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively.
8762097	PPADS and suramin as antagonists at cloned P2Y- and P2U-purinoceptors.	1. The effect of suramin and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) on the stimulation of phospholipase C in 1321N1 cells transfected with the human P2U-purinoceptor (h-P2U-1321N1 cells) or with the turkey P2Y-purinoceptor (t-P2Y-1321N1 cells) was investigated. 2-Methylthioadenosine triphosphate (2MeSATP) was used as the agonist at t-P2Y-1321N1 cells and uridine triphosphate (UTP) at h-P2U-1321N1 cells. 2. Suramin caused a parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curves for 2MeSATP in the t-P2Y-1321N1 cells, yielding a Schild plot with a slope of 1.16 +/- 0.08 and a pA2 value of 5.77 +/- 0.11. 3. Suramin also caused a shift to the right of concentration-response curves for UTP in the h-P2U-1321N1 cells, and on Schild plots gave a slope different from unity (1.57 +/- 0.19) and an apparent pA2 value of 4.32 +/- 0.13. Suramin was therefore a less potent antagonist at the P2U-purinoceptor than the P2Y-purinoceptor. 4. In the presence of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor, ARL 67156 (6-N,N-diethyl-beta,gamma-dibromomethylene-D-ATP) there was no significant difference in the EC50 or shapes of curves with either cell type, and no difference in pA2 values for suramin. 5. PPADS caused an increase in the EC50 for 2MeSATP in the t-P2Y-1321N1 cells. The Schild plot had a slope different from unity (0.55 +/- 0.15) and an X-intercept corresponding to an apparent pA2 of 5.98 +/- 0.65. 6. PPADS up to 30 microM had no effect on the concentration-response curve for UTP with the h-P2U-1321N1 cells. 7. In conclusion, suramin and PPADS show clear differences in their action at the 2 receptor types, in each case being substantially more effective as an antagonist at the P2Y-purinoceptor than at the P2U-purinoceptor. Ectonucleotidase breakdown had little influence on the nature of the responses at the two receptor types, or in their differential sensitivity to suramin.
8781782	Nonlinear dorzolamide pharmacokinetics in rats: concentration-dependent erythrocyte distribution and drug-metabolite displacement interaction.	The disposition of dorzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II) inhibitor, was examined in rats after oral and iv administration of 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 25 mg/kg. The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in an approximately dose-proportional fashion up to 0.5 mg/kg. However, at the higher dorzolamide doses there was an unusual 52% decrease in AUC with increasing dose from 0.5 to 25 mg/kg. This was due to a combination of concentration-dependent red blood cell (RBC)/plasma distribution and a competitive drug-metabolite displacement interaction that increased the time-averaged blood clearance by more than 100-fold over the dose range examined. Extensive and saturable binding to the CA-II that is present in RBCs is characteristic of this compound class. However, saturation of binding to the blood enzyme was not sufficient to explain the observed decrease in the AUC at the higher dose levels. A further increase in blood clearance was attributed to the displacement of dorzolamide from the CA-II binding sites by its active N-desethyl metabolite. The proposed mechanism was evaluated in studies that examined the effect of the metabolite on the distribution of dorzolamide between RBCs and plasma. Ex vivo and in vitro assessments of the equilibrium RBC/ plasma concentration ratio indicated that metabolite displacement of dorzolamide from enzyme binding sites in RBC occurs at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.
8786535	Anesthetics produce subunit-selective actions on glutamate receptors.	We assessed the involvement of specific glutamate receptors in the action of anesthetics. In addition to the clinical anesthetics enflurane, isoflurane and halothane, we tested novel halogenated compounds, which are anesthetic or nonanesthetic in vivo, on glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits. these volatile compounds as well as pentobarbital and phenobarbital were tested on kainate-induced currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing GluR1, GluR3, GluR2+3 or GluR6 subunits. The anesthetic 1-chloro-1,2,2-triflurocyclobutane (F3) weakly inhibited kainate responses in oocytes expressing GluR3 receptors but not oocytes expressing GluR1 or GluR2+3 receptors. Surprisingly, F3 potentiated kainate responses in oocytes expressing the kainate-selective receptor GluR6. The nonanesthetics 2,3-chlorooctafluorobutane (F8) and 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (F6) did not affect GluR3 or GluR6 kainate responses. Isoflurane weakly inhibited although enflurane and halothane modestly inhibited kainate responses in oocytes expressing GluR1, GluR3 or GluR2+3 receptors. As with F3, isoflurane, enflurane and halothane potentiated kainate-induced currents of GluR6 receptors. The respective inhibitory and potentiating effects of halothane on GluR3 and GluR6 receptors were enhanced by increasing duration of halothane exposure. In contrast to the opposing action of volatile anesthetics, pentobarbital and phenobarbital inhibited GluR3 and GluR6 kainate responses and had a much greater effect on GluR6 receptors. These results provide novel evidence that anesthetics produce selective actions on glutamate receptors, suggesting that subunit composition may determine the role of glutamate receptors in anesthesia.
8787774	Characterization of peripheral benzodiazepine type sites in a cultured murine BV-2 microglial cell line.	It is known that the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) increases after brain damage. Astrocytes are among the cell types where PBR ligand binding has been detected and may be involved in the response to neuronal injury and regeneration. Consistent with the hypothesis, the apparent density of PBR sites in astrocytes is increased by both cytokines and neurotoxins. However, microglia, the resident macrophages which represent 5-15% of glial cell populations have not been evaluated for the presence of the PBR. In the present study, we report the presence of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding in microglial cells. In particular, we used BV-2 cells, an immortalized cell line of murine microglial cells. High affinity binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to a single site was detected in membranes prepared from BV-2 cells (KD = 4.4 nM, Bmax = 3,800 fmoles/mg protein). Various ligands for the PBR displaced [3H]Ro5-4864 binding with the following rank order of potencies: PK11195 = Ro5-4864 > FGIN-1-27 > triazolam = diazepam > beta-pro-pyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate = clonazepam > lorazepam = flurazepam > chlordiazepoxide = clorazepate. Subcellular fractionationstudies indicate that the majority of the Ro5-4864 binding sites is in the mitochondrial fraction. The remainder is found in nonmitochondrial cell fractions. The [3H]Ro5-4864 binding observed on intact cells had characteristics similar to those found on membranes. The presence of a high density of PBRs in these cells establish the basis for additional investigations into their possible functional role, if any, in the microglial response to neuronal injury.
8788445	(-)-Pentazocine analgesia in mice: interactions with a sigma receptor system.	(-)-Pentazocine is active in the tailflick assay in CD-1 mice, although it shows a biphasic dose-response curve with a peak effect of only 30%. Co-administration of haloperidol shifts the dose-response curve to the left and elevates the maximal response to 70% through a blockade of sigma 1 receptors, but the curve remains biphasic. (+)-Pentazocine is inactive in all antinociceptive assays, either alone or with haloperidol. The analgesic actions of (-)-pentazocine are readily reversed by nor-binaltorphimine, but not by the mu-selective opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine, implying a kappa 1-opioid receptor mechanism of action. This conclusion is supported by the ability of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against the KOR-1 clone, which encodes the kappa 1-opioid receptor, to block (-)-pentazocine analgesia.
8809191	Differential effects of trilostane and cyanoketone on the 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase reactions in androgen and 16-androstene biosynthetic pathways in the pig testis.	3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase (3 beta-HSD-I) activity in the pig testis is responsible for the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) to 4-androstenedione and also for the conversion of 5,16-androstadien-3 beta-ol (andien-beta) to 4, 16-androstadien-3-one (dienone). Therefore, 3 beta-HSD-I plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of hormonally and pheromonally active steroids. Previous studies from this laboratory have suggested that the 3 beta-HSD-I reactions in the androgen and 16-androstene biosynthetic pathways may be catalysed by different enzymes with selective substrate specificities [3, 4]. The aim of the present studies was to investigate the reactions further by examining the effects of two classical steroidal inhibitors of 3 beta-HSD-I, trilostane (WIN 24540) and cyanoketone (WIN 19578), on the kinetic parameters of the 3 beta-HSD-I reactions in immature (< 3 weeks) pig testis microsomes. In kinetic analyses of the conversion of DHA to 4-androstenedione, both trilostane and cyanoketone caused increases in the Km(app) for DHA which at the highest concentration used, were 15-fold the control Km(app) of 1.4 mumol/l. No effect on the Vmax(app) (6.55 +/- 0.74 nmol/h/mg protein) was observed, demonstrating that competitive inhibition was evident. Slope and intercept replots confirmed the competitive nature of the inhibition and Ki(app) values of 0.16 mumol/l for trilostane and 0.20 mumol/l for cyanoketone were respectively 9 and 7-fold lower than the Km(app) value. In contrast, trilostane and cyanoketone had no effect on the Km(app) for andien-beta (0.26 mumol/l). The Vmax(app) (1.12 nmol/h/mg protein) was decreased by 40-50% only by trilostane at the highest concentration used, demonstrating a very low affinity for the andien-beta active site. Ki(app) values for trilostane and cyanoketone, obtained from slope and intercept replots were, respectively 1.1 and 1.6 mumol/l, which were 4 and 6-fold greater than the Km(app) for andien-beta. Therefore, trilostane and cyanoketone were powerful competitive inhibitors of the conversion of DHA to 4-androstenedione but were weak non-competitive inhibitors of the conversion of andien-beta to dienone. The selective effects of trilostane and cyanoketone on the 3 beta-HSD-Is involved in the androgen and 16-androstene biosynthetic pathways strongly suggest that the reactions are catalysed by separate enzymes, or at least separate, non-interacting active sites on a single enzyme.
8842678	Effects of long-term treatment with dicyclic, tricyclic, tetracyclic, and noncyclic antidepressant drugs on monoamine oxidase activity in mouse brain.	1. The individual long-term effects of the antidepressant drugs zimeldine, viloxazine, imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, maprotiline, or nomifensine, on brain mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, were studied in mice that were given daily intraperitoneal injections (30 mg/kg) of these reagents for 4 weeks. 2. Both the A-form (MAO-A) and B-form (MAO-B) of MAO were inhibited after long-term administration of all the drugs except nortriptyline (MAO-A was not affected) and maprotiline (neither MAO-A nor MAO-B were affected). 3. Kinetic analysis showed a significant decrease in Vmax values, and an increase in K(m) values for MAO-B during treatment. 4. All seven drugs are competitive inhibitors of MAO-A, noncompetitive inhibitors of MAO-B, and were more potent in vitro for MAO-B. 5. MAO-A was inhibited by the following drugs (in ascending order of potency) : nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, maprotiline, zimeldine, nomifensine, and viloxazine. 6. MAO-B was inhibited by the following drugs (in ascending order of potency): nortriptyline, imipramine, maprotiline, amitriptyline, zimeldine, nomifensine, and viloxazine.
8876023	Interactions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with the serotonin 5-HT2c receptor.	Interactions of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, fluoxetine and its main metabolite norfluoxetine, and the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) imipramine with the rat serotonin 5-HT2C receptor in a clonal cell line and in the rat choroid plexus were investigated by radioligand binding and phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis assays. For comparison, the affinities of a variety of other antidepressants of different chemical classes for the cloned rat 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptors were also determined by radioligand binding assays. Fluoxetine displayed relatively high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor in the choroid plexus, with a Ki value for inhibition of [3H]mesulergine binding of 55.4 nM. The Ki values for imipramine, norfluoxetine and citalopram were 136 nM, 203 nM, and 298 nM, respectively. Similar rank order of potency was detected in PI hydrolysis assays, which showed that these drugs are antagonists at the 5-HT2C receptor without exhibiting inverse agonist activity. [3H]Ketanserin (5-HT2A) binding assays revealed that the SSRIs fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and citalopram show 10- to 23-fold selectivity for the 5-HT2C receptor in vitro, whereas the TCA imipramine does not. Many other TCAs also had high to intermediate affinity for both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The present data provide evidence that fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and citalopram, along with many other antidepressant compounds, interact directly with the 5-HT2C receptor.
8886398	Effects of memantine on recombinant rat NMDA receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells.	1. The actions of the uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane) and (+)-MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate, dizocilpine), on recombinant NMDA receptors has been studied by use of the whole-cell patch clamp technique. 2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transiently transfected with different NMDA receptor subunit combinations (NR1a/NR2A, NR1a/NR2B and NR1a/NR2D). A mutant form of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cotransfected with the NMDA receptor subunits to enable the visualization of transfected cells. 3. Memantine (0.3-30 microM) blocked L-glutamate (100 microM)-mediated currents in a concentration-dependent manner in NR1a/NR2A, NR1a/NR2B and NR1a/NR2D transfected cells with IC50 values (at -70 mV) of 0.93 +/- 0.15 microM, 0.82 +/- 0.12 microM and 0.47 +/- 0.06 microM (mean +/- s.c. mean), respectively. 4. The memantine-induced block was strongly voltage-dependent. Alteration of the holding potential from -70 mV to +60 mV resulted in an e-fold increase in the IC50 values per 30-33 mV change in membrane potential, for all 3 subunit combinations investigated. 5. The kinetics of the actions of memantine (30 microM) were investigated for the NR1a/2A combination, in 6 cells (13-15 determinations). At -70 mV, the block and recovery from block were both best described by two exponentials with time-constants of 201 +/- 23 ms (81 +/- 2%) and 3.9 +/- 0.6 s and 597 +/- 94 ms (18 +/- 1%) and 18.6 +/- 2.4 s, respectively. The predominant effect of depolarization was to increase the weight of the faster recovery time-constant. Kinetic analysis suggests that these results are consistent with previously proposed Markov models. 6. (+)-MK-801 was studied briefly for comparative purposes. (+)-MK-801 (200 nM) preferentially blocked NMDA receptor currents (at -70 mV) in NR1a/NR2A and NR1a/NR2B (82 +/- 10% and 93 +/- 2% depressions) compared to NR1a/NR2D (38 +/- 7%) transfected cells. (+)-MK-801 appeared to be less voltage-dependent than memantine on all three receptor combinations. 7. In conclusion, memantine was a voltage-dependent antagonist of recombinant rat NMDA receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells but showed little selectivity between the subunits investigated. Its actions on these recombinant receptor combinations are similar to its actions on native NMDA receptors.
8904614	5-HT1D receptor agonists and human coronary artery reactivity in vitro: crossover comparisons of 5-HT and sumatriptan with rizatriptan and L-741,519.	1. Rizatriptan (MK-462, (N,N-dimethyl-2-[5-(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1H-indol-3-yl] ethylamine)) and its structurally related analogue L-741,519 (N-methyl-4-[5-(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl]piperidine) are novel 5-HT1D-receptor agonists. Rizatriptan has shown efficacy as an anti-migraine agent in clinical trials. Since angiographic studies in patients have shown that sumatriptan (an established 5-HT1D-receptor agonist) can cause coronary artery vasoconstriction, we compared the effects of rizatriptan and L-741,519 with those of 5-HT and sumatriptan on endothelium-denuded segments of human coronary artery in vitro. 2. Coronary arteries were obtained from explanted hearts from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (n = 16 viable arteries from 13 males, 3 females, aged 38-68 years) and arterial segments (5-6 mm in length) were mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recording. Each segment was first exposed to 45mM KCl and then to 5-HT (1 nM-100 microM). Concentration-effect curves to rizatriptan and sumatriptan (Study 1, n = 6 or 7 arteries) or sumatriptan and L-741,519 (Study 2, n = 8 arteries) were then performed in a consecutive and random manner. The response to repeated application of 5-HT was obtained in separate segments. 3. One artery showed severe atheroma and was not included in the analysis. ANOVA showed that 5-HT responsiveness varied significantly between arteries from different patients; but not between arterial segments from the same patient. Desensitization was seen consistently across all agonists but did not significantly affect inter-agonist comparisons. 4. There was graded effectiveness in the ability of the agonists to cause contraction with the rank order of Emax values being 5-HT > sumatriptan > L-741,519 > rizatriptan. In terms of EC50 values, L-741,519 was significantly more potent than sumatriptan. 5. The present study (using a 'cross-over' experimental protocol) confirms our previous observation that rizatriptan is less effective than sumatriptan in causing contraction of human isolated coronary artery. Furthermore, it shows that the lower maximum contractile response to rizatriptan, compared with that of sumatriptan, is not merely the consequence of variability in response to 5-HT1D-receptor agonists between patients or between segments from the same artery.
8922878	The novel progestin drospirenone and its natural counterpart progesterone: biochemical profile and antiandrogenic potential.	Drospirenone is a novel progestin under clinical development that is similar to the natural hormone progesterone, combining potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities. This specific pharmacological profile of drospirenone is defined by its pattern of binding affinities to a variety of steroid hormone receptors. In the present study the affinity of drospirenone to the progesterone receptor (PR), the androgen receptor (AR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the estrogen receptor (ER) was re-evaluated by steroid binding assays and compared to those obtained for the natural hormone progesterone. Drospirenone displayed high affinity to PR and MR and low binding to AR, similar to progesterone. Unlike progesterone, which showed considerable binding to GR, drospirenone exhibited only low binding to this receptor. Neither drospirenone nor progesterone did bind to the ER. In addition to receptor binding studies, transactivation assays were carried out to investigate the effects of drospirenone and progesterone on AR-, GR-, and MR-mediated induction of transcription. Both progestins showed no androgenic but antiandrogenic activity by inhibiting AR-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner. This observation could be confirmed by in vivo experiments carried out with orchiectomized male rats, where the antiandrogenic potency of drospirenone was found to be about five- to ten-fold higher than that of progesterone. In contrast to progesterone, drospirenone was devoid of glucocorticoid activity. Both progestins did not show any antiglucocorticoid action. Furthermore, drospirenone and progesterone both showed considerable antimineralocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity.
8997630	Iloperidone binding to human and rat dopamine and 5-HT receptors.	Iloperidone (HP 873; 1-[4-[3-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]propoxy] -3- methoxyphenyl]ethanone) is a compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. Iloperidone displays affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and for 5-HT2A receptors and has a variety of in vivo activities suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic. Here we present an examination of the affinity of iloperidone to a variety of human and rat homologs of dopamine and 5-HT receptor subtypes. We employed receptor binding assays using membranes from cells stably expressing human dopamine D1, D2S, D2L, D3, D4 and D5 and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and rat 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors. Iloperidone displayed higher affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor (Ki = 7.1 nM) than for the dopamine D4 receptor (Ki = 25 nM). Iloperidone displayed high affinity for the 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors (Ki = 42.7 and 21.6 nM, respectively), and was found to have higher affinity for the 5-HT2A (Ki = 5.6 nM) than for the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 42.8 nM). The potential implications of this receptor binding profile are discussed in comparison with data for other antipsychotic compounds.
9013583	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma are activated by indomethacin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and cyclooxygenase inhibitor that is frequently used as a research tool to study the process of adipocyte differentiation. Treatment of various preadipocyte cell lines with micromolar concentrations of indomethacin in the presence of insulin promotes their terminal differentiation. However, the molecular basis for the adipogenic actions of indomethacin had remained unclear. In this report, we show that indomethacin binds and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a ligand-activated transcription factor known to play a pivotal role in adipogenesis. The concentration of indomethacin required to activate PPARgamma is in good agreement with that required to induce the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells to adipocytes. We demonstrate that several other NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and flufenamic acid, are also PPARgamma ligands and induce adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Finally, we show that the same NSAIDs that activate PPARgamma are also efficacious activators of PPARalpha, a liver-enriched PPAR subtype that plays a key role in peroxisome proliferation. Interestingly, several NSAIDs have been reported to induce peroxisomal activity in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings define a novel group of PPARgamma ligands and provide a molecular basis for the biological effects of these drugs on adipogenesis and peroxisome activity.
9035701	Tazarotene--first of a new generation of receptor-selective retinoids.	Tazarotene is a topically applied retinoid that targets the skin, the site of the fundamental defect(s) in psoriasis, modulating the major causes of the disease and achieving sustained efficacy. In vitro, binding of tazarotenic acid has been demonstrated to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), the probable molecular target of retinoid action in adult human skin, but not to retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In gene activation assays, tazarotene is selective for the RAR beta and RAR gamma subtypes. This selectivity could theoretically limit undesirable effects at the receptor level. In vitro, animal and clinical evidence reveals that topical tazarotene modulates all three pathogenic factors in psoriasis: abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, hyperproliferation, and increased expression of inflammatory markers. Tazarotene is minimally absorbed systemically after topical administration. Tazarotene is rapidly metabolized by esterase metabolism to its active free-acid form, tazarotenic acid, which has a relatively short elimination half-life (1-2 h). The pharmacokinetic profile of tazarotenic acid is predictable, with no significant accumulation. In preclinical toxicity studies, high topical doses produced only reversible topical irritation, and lower doses were well tolerated. Topical doses were neither carcinogenic nor teratogenic, had no effect on fertility or general reproduction, and were not phototoxic, sensitizing, or photoallergenic. The pharmacological selectivity of tazarotene and limited systemic exposure result in minimal systemic effects, while the lesser cytotoxic effects (relative to other retinoids) result in reduced local effects.
9048584	Comparison of the ligand binding specificity and transcript tissue distribution of estrogen receptors alpha and beta.	The rat estrogen receptor (ER) exists as two subtypes, ER alpha and ER beta, which differ in the C-terminal ligand binding domain and in the N-terminal transactivation domain. In this study we investigated the messenger RNA expression of both ER subtypes in rat tissues by RT-PCR and compared the ligand binding specificity of the ER subtypes. Saturation ligand binding analysis of in vitro synthesized human ER alpha and rat ER beta protein revealed a single binding component for 16 alpha-iodo-17 beta-estradiol with high affinity [dissociation constant (Kd) = 0.1 nM for ER alpha protein and 0.4 nM for ER beta protein]. Most estrogenic substances or estrogenic antagonists compete with 16 alpha-[125I]iodo-17 beta-estradiol for binding to both ER subtypes in a very similar preference and degree; that is, diethylstilbestrol > hexestrol > dienestrol > 4-OH-tamoxifen > 17 beta-estradiol > coumestrol, ICI-164384 > estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol > nafoxidine, moxestrol > clomifene > estriol, 4-OH-estradiol > tamoxifen, 2-OH-estradiol, 5-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol, genistein for the ER alpha protein and dienestrol > 4-OH-tamoxifen > diethylstilbestrol > hexestrol > coumestrol, ICI-164384 > 17 beta-estradiol > estrone, genistein > estriol > nafoxidine, 5-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol > 17 alpha-estradiol, clomifene, 2-OH-estradiol > 4-OH-estradiol, tamoxifen, moxestrol for the ER beta protein. The rat tissue distribution and/or the relative level of ER alpha and ER beta expression seems to be quite different, i.e. moderate to high expression in uterus, testis, pituitary, ovary, kidney, epididymis, and adrenal for ER alpha and prostate, ovary, lung, bladder, brain, uterus, and testis for ER beta. The described differences between the ER subtypes in relative ligand binding affinity and tissue distribution could contribute to the selective action of ER agonists and antagonists in different tissues.
9056052	Initial human experience with MK-462 (rizatriptan): a novel 5-HT1D agonist.	We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral MK-462 in comparison with oral sumatriptan in healthy male volunteers.
9108546	Analysis in yeast of antimalaria drugs that target the dihydrofolate reductase of Plasmodium falciparum.	Pyrimethamine and cycloguanil are competitive inhibitors of the Plasmodium enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They have been effective treatments for malaria, but rapid selection of populations of the parasite resistant to these drugs has compromised their effectiveness. Parasites resistant to either drug usually have point mutations in the dhfr gene, but the frequency of these mutations is unknown. To study drug resistance more effectively, we transferred the DHFR domain of the dhfr-thymidylate synthase gene from a drug-sensitive line of P. falciparum to a strain of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that lacks endogenous DHFR activity. Expression of the P. falciparum dhfr is controlled by the yeast dhfr 5' and 3' regulatory regions and the heterologous enzyme provided all of the functions of the yeast dhfr gene. These yeast were susceptible to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil at low concentrations that inhibit P. falciparum (IC50 about 10(-8) and 10(-7) M, respectively). Yeast expressing constructs with dhfr alleles from pyrimethamine-resistant strains were resistant to both pyrimethamine and cycloguanil (IC50 > 10(-6) M); resistance of the yeast depended on the dhfr allele they expressed. The experimental drug WR99210 efficiently killed all three yeast strains (IC50 about 10(-8) M) but the pyrR strains showed collateral hypersensitivity to drug. The yeast transformants carrying the drug-sensitive allele can now be screened quickly and quantitatively to identify new drugs or combinations of drugs and determine which drugs select resistant parasites least efficiently. Such compounds would be excellent candidates for development of treatments with a longer life in clinical practice.
9120573	Trapping channel block of NMDA-activated responses by amantadine and memantine.	We investigated the mechanisms by which the antiparkinsonian and neuroprotective agents amantadine and memantine inhibit responses to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). Whole cell recordings were performed using cultured rat cortical neurons or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing NMDA receptors. Both amantadine and memantine blocked NMDA-activated channels by binding to a site at which they could be trapped after channel closure and agonist unbinding. For neuronal receptors, the IC50s of amantadine and memantine at -67 mV were 39 and 1.4 microM, respectively. When memantine and agonists were washed off after steady-state block, one-sixth of the blocked channels released rather than trapped the blocker; memantine exhibited "partial trapping." Thus memantine appears to have a lesser tendency to be trapped than do phencyclidine or (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[1,d]cyclihepten-5,1 0-imine (MK-801). We next investigated mechanisms that might underlie partial trapping. Memantine blocked and could be trapped by recombinant NMDA receptors composed of NR1 and either NR2A or NR2B subunits. In these receptors, as in the native receptors, the drug was released from one-sixth of blocked channels rather than being trapped in all of them. The partial trapping we observed therefore was not due to variability in the action of memantine on a heterogeneous population of NMDA receptors in cultured cortical neurons. Amantadine and memantine each noncompetitively inhibited NMDA-activated responses by binding at a second site with roughly 100-fold lower affinity, but this form of inhibition had little effect on the extent to which memantine was trapped. A simple kinetic model of blocker action was used to demonstrate that partial trapping can result if the presence of memantine in the channel affects the gating transitions or agonist affinity of the NMDA receptor. Partial trapping guarantees that during synaptic communication in the presence of blocker, some channels will release the blocker between synaptic responses. The extent to which amantadine and memantine become trapped after channel block thus may influence their therapeutic effects and their modulation of NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials.
9127118	Comparison of the vasoconstrictor properties of the 5-HT1D-receptor agonists rizatriptan (MK-462) and sumatriptan in human isolated coronary artery: outcome of two independent studies using different experimental protocols.	Rizatriptan (MK-462) is a novel 5-HT1D-receptor agonist and is effective in the treatment of migraine headache. As angiographic studies have shown that the prototypic 5-HT1D/1B-receptor agonist sumatriptan can cause coronary artery constriction in patients with mild coronary artery disease, we have compared the contractile effects of rizatriptan on human isolated coronary artery with those of sumatriptan and 5-HT. Two different experimental protocols were used. In Study 1 (to avoid agonist desensitisation and interaction effects), arterial segments were exposed to a single agonist (either 5-HT, sumatriptan or rizatriptan) and in Study 2 each arterial segment was exposed to all three agonists with randomised first exposure to sumatriptan or rizatriptan. In both these studies the maximum contractions evoked by sumatriptan and rizatriptan were found to be smaller than those evoked by 5-HT, and the maximum contraction evoked by rizatriptan was significantly smaller than that for sumatriptan.
9127492	Arabidopsis dihydropteroate synthase: general properties and inhibition by reaction product and sulfonamides.	Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) (EC 2.5.1.15) was extracted from leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana and purified 21-fold by ion-exchange chromatography. This enzyme preparation was then characterized for several of its properties. Michaelis-Menten constants for the substrates, p-aminobenzoic acid and dihydropteridine diphosphate were estimated to be 2.5 and 91 microM, respectively. In an optimized assay, the reaction product, dihydropteroic acid, competitively inhibited the enzyme activity with a Ki of 81 microM. However, neither dihydropteroic acid nor tetrahydrofolate, products further downstream in the biosynthetic pathway inhibited enzymatic activity. This appears to be the first report of product inhibition of DHPS from a higher plant. The relative inhibitory properties of several sulfonamides, analogues of p-aminobenzoic acid, were also examined. The substitutions on the amide nitrogen of the sulfonamides influenced the degree of inhibition; thus I50 values for the inhibition of the DHPS activity by sulfanilamide, sulfacetamide and sulfadiazine were estimated to be 18.6, 9.6 and 4.2 microM, respectively. The competitive pattern of inhibition was shown in experiments with sulfadiazine.
9145928	Study of the interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and Asn386 in helix VII of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor.	We studied the stereoselective interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor. R- and S-enantiomers of propranolol, penbutolol, and alprenolol were investigated for their ability to bind to human 5-HT1A wild-type and Asn386Val mutant receptors. Asn386 seemed to act as a chiral discriminator. Although both aryloxypropanol enantiomers displayed lower affinity for the mutant receptors, the affinities for the S-enantiomers were more affected. Receptor affinities of other structurally unrelated 5-HT1A ligands were not decreased by the mutation of Asn386 to valine. In addition, a series of analogues of propranolol with structural variation in the oxypropanolamine moiety was synthesized, and affinities for wild-type and Asn386Val mutant 5-HT1A receptors were determined. Both the hydroxyl and the ether oxygen atoms of the oxypropanol moiety seem to be required for binding at wild-type 5-HT1A receptors. The hydroxyl group of propranolol probably directly interacts with Asn386. The ether oxygen atom may be important for steric reasons but can also be involved in a direct interaction with Asn386. These findings are in agreement with the interactions of aryloxypropanolamines with Asn386 in rat 5-HT1A receptors that we previously proposed. The loss of affinity for propranolol by the Asn386Val mutation could be regained by replacement of the hydroxyl group of the ligand by a methoxy group. This modification of the propranolol structure has no effect on the affinity of both enantiomers for the wild-type 5-HT1A receptor, which provides an alternative hypothesis for the interaction of Asn386 with the oxypropanol oxygen atoms. According to this novel hypothesis, the oxypropanol oxygen atoms may both act as hydrogen bond acceptors from the NH2 group of Asn386.
9152412	Prostaglandin E2 production dependent upon cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 and its contradictory modulation by auranofin in rat peritoneal macrophages.	Rat peritoneal macrophages were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide or dexamethasone to inhibit the induction of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein synthesis. Thereafter, when the macrophages were incubated in the presence of arachidonic acid, PGE2 production was increased. Western blot analysis demonstrated that COX-2 protein levels were low and were not affected by arachidonic acid treatment. COX-1 protein levels were not affected by arachidonic acid treatment either. The COX-2 inhibitors NS-398 and nimesulide only slightly inhibited PGE2 production, whereas the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors indomethacin, piroxicam and tenoxicam strongly inhibited PGE2 production. This suggests that under these conditions, PGE2 production is dependent on COX-1. After the macrophages were treated with aspirin to inactivate existing COX-1 and COX-2, however, treatment with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate increased PGE2 production. Furthermore, COX-2 protein levels were markedly increased by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment, whereas COX-1 protein levels did not change. In this case, both the COX-2 and the COX-1/ COX-2 inhibitors inhibited PGE2 production. This suggest that under these conditions, PGE2 production is dependent on COX-2. Effects of auranofin on COX-1-dependent and COX-2-dependent PGE2 production were examined. We found that auranofin stimulated COX-1-dependent PGE2 production but inhibited COX-2-dependent PGE2 production in a concentration-dependent manner. The latter effect was found to be due to the inhibition of COX-2 protein induction. These findings might explain the mechanism of the antirheumatic and anti-inflammatory activities of auranofin.
9256165	Inhibition of extracellular release of proinflammatory secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) by sulfasalazine: a novel mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity.	Sulfasalazine is widely used in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The mechanisms of its activity have not been elucidated. In leukocytes, sulfasalazine and its analogue, CL 42A, inhibited the formation of leukotrienes and possibly of the second messenger compounds at the level of phospholipase C. Partial inhibition of interleukin-lbeta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also found. Since the synthesis of eicosanoids is induced by phospholipase A2 and since secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is proinflammatory, we investigated the impact of sulfasalazine and related compounds on mRNA, protein synthesis, and release of sPLA2 from osteoblasts. Sulfasalazine and CL 42A markedly inhibited extracellular release of sPLA2. The impact of sulfasalazine was evident at 50 microM (P < 0.001) and maximal at 400 microM, and that of CL 42A at 10 microM (P < 0.001) and 200 microM, respectively. Split products of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (400 microM) and sulfapyridine (400 microM), had no impact. The effect of sulfasalazine and CL 42A was evident regardless of whether the cells were stimulated with IL-1beta/TNF-alpha, lipopolysaccharide/forskolin, or dibutyryl-cAMP. Sulfasalazine and CL 42A did not alter the level of sPLA2 mRNA. Exposure of stimulated fetal rat calvaria osteoblasts (FRCO) to sulfasalazine did not show accumulation of the intracellular sPLA2 protein as tested by western blot; however, enzymatic activity of PLA2 in disrupted cells was definitely increased. Thus, the impact is on the post-transcriptional release of sPLA2 rather than on the synthesis. There was also an increase in the extracellular release of prostaglandin E2 from FRCO exposed to sulfasalazine or to CL 42A. In contrast, sulfasalazine had no effect on the extracellular release of gelatinase from the cells or on mRNA of cytosolic PLA2 or cyclooxygenase 2. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory activity of sulfasalazine may be related, in part, to the selective inhibition of the extracellular release of proinflammatory sPLA2.
9259062	Effects of the AT1-selective angiotensin II antagonist, telmisartan, on hemodynamics and ventricular function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pigs.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the angiotensin II (ANG II) antagonist, telmisartan, on hemodynamics, myocardial function and myocardial blood flow during the postresuscitation phase in a porcine model of CPR and to compare these to saline. After 4 min of ventricular fibrillation and 5 min of closed-chest CPR, defibrillation was performed in 16 domestic pigs to restore spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Ten minutes after ROSC, animals were allocated to receive either the ANG II antagonist, telmisartan, at a dose of 1 mg/kg (n = 8) or saline (n = 8). Hemodynamics, myocardial function and myocardial blood flow were measured prearrest and at 5, 30, 90 and 240 min after ROSC. Using a Swan-Ganz catheter with a fast responding-thermistor and a micromanometer tipped catheter, right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular contractility were 67 +/- 6 ml (mean +/- S.E.M.), 42 +/- 4 ml, 38 +/- 2%, 2036 +/- 77 mmHg/s in the telmisartan group and 82 +/- 2 ml (P < 0.05), 59 +/- 3 ml (P < 0.01), 28 +/- 2% (P < 0.01), 1596 +/- 82 mmHg/s (P < 0.01) in the control group, at 240 min after ROSC. No significant differences in mean aortic and pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index or myocardial blood flow between the two groups were found. We conclude that the ANG II antagonist telmisartan administered during the postresuscitation phase in pigs increases myocardial contractility without changing cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, or myocardial perfusion.
9310465	Adult mice with targeted mutation of the interleukin-11 receptor (IL11Ra) display normal hematopoiesis.	Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic growth factor with a prominent effect on megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. The receptor for IL-11 is a heterodimer of the signal transduction unit gp130 and a specific receptor component, the alpha-chain (IL-11R alpha). Two genes potentially encode the IL-11R alpha: the IL11Ra and IL11Ra2 genes. The IL11Ra gene is widely expressed in hematopoietic and other organs, whereas the IL11Ra2 gene is restricted to only some strains of mice and its expression is confined to testis, lymph node, and thymus. To investigate the essential actions mediated by the IL-11R alpha, we have generated mice with a null mutation of IL11Ra (IL11Ra-/-) by gene targeting. Analysis of IL11Ra expression by Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, as well as the absence of response of IL11Ra-/- bone marrow cells to IL-11 in hematopoietic assays, further confirmed the null mutation. Compensatory expression of the IL11Ra2 in bone marrow cells was not detected. IL11Ra-/- mice were healthy with normal numbers of peripheral blood white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets. Bone marrow and spleen contained normal numbers of cells of all hematopoietic lineages, including megakaryocytes. Clonal cultures did not identify any perturbation of granulocyte-macrophage (GM), erythroid, or megakaryocyte progenitors. The number of day-12 colony-forming unit-spleen progenitors were similar in wild-type and IL11Ra-/- mice. The kinetics of recovery of peripheral blood white blood cells, platelets, and bone marrow GM progenitors after treatment with 5-flurouracil were the same in IL11Ra-/- and wild-type mice. Acute hemolytic stress was induced by phenylhydrazine and resulted in a 50% decrease in hematocrit. The recovery of hematocrit was comparable in IL11Ra-/ - and wild-type mice. These observations indicate that IL-11 receptor signalling is dispensable for adult hematopoiesis.
9326581	A yeast sterol auxotroph (erg25) is rescued by addition of azole antifungals and reduced levels of heme.	Genetic disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae C-4 sterol methyl oxidase ERG25 gene leads to sterol auxotrophy. We have characterized a suppression system that requires two mutations to restore viability to this disrupted strain. One suppressor mutation is erg11, which is blocked in 14alpha-demethylation of lanosterol and is itself an auxotroph. The second suppressor mutation required is either slu1 or slu2 (suppressor of lanosterol utilization). These mutations are leaky versions of HEM2 and HEM4, respectively; addition of exogenous hemin reverses the suppressing effects of slu1 and slu2. Suppression of erg25 by erg11 slu1 (or erg11 slu2) results in a slow-growing strain in which lanosterol, the first sterol in the pathway, accumulates. This result indicates that endogenously synthesized lanosterol can substitute for ergosterol and support growth. In the triple mutants, all but 1 (ERG6) of the 13 subsequent reactions of the ergosterol pathway are inactive. Azole antibiotics (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole) widely used to combat fungal infections are known to do so by inhibiting the ERG11 gene product, the 14alpha-demethylase. In this investigation, we demonstrate that treatment of the sterol auxotrophs erg25 slu1 or erg25 slu2 with azole antibiotics paradoxically restores viability to these strains in the absence of sterol supplementation via the suppression system we have described.
9357398	Olsalazine and 6-mercaptopurine-related bone marrow suppression: a possible drug-drug interaction.	A patient with refractory Crohn's disease had two separate episodes of bone marrow suppression while receiving 50 to 75 mg 6-mercaptopurine a day and 1000 to 1750 mg olsalazine a day. This adverse reaction necessitated dose reduction of 6-mercaptopurine on the first occasion and withdrawal of 6-mercaptopurine and olsalazine on the second occasion. The patient's red blood cell thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity was 1.2 U per milliliter red blood cells (low normal range) and her TPMT genotype was wild-type sequence for all known alleles of TPMT that result in low TPMT enzyme activity. In vitro enzyme kinetic studies confirmed the hypothesis that olsalazine and olsalazine-O-sulfate are potent noncompetitive inhibitors of recombinant human TPMT. We suggest that the patient's relatively low baseline level of TPMT activity was inhibited by olsalazine and olsalazine-O-sulfate, leading to decreased clearance of 6-mercaptopurine and its accumulation. This ultimately increased intracellular 6-thiopurine nucleotide levels to toxic concentrations, which caused bone marrow suppression.
9364810	[Relationship between streptomycin susceptibility and rpsL mutations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains].	The relationship between streptomycin (SM) susceptibility and rpsL mutations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains was studied. Of 18 clinically isolated SM-resistant M.tuberculosis strains, mutation was suspected in 9 strains (50%) with SM MICs of > or = 256 micrograms/ml by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism targeting rpsL gene. On the other hand, using PCR-direct sequence method, amino acid substitution caused by single nucleotide point mutation in rpsL gene was demonstrated in 11 out of 18 strains (61%). The same amino acid substitution at codon 43 (Lys-->Arg) was observed in all 11 strains with SM MICs of > or = 256 micrograms/ml. In addition, PCR products obtained from these 11 strains could not be cut by a restriction enzyme, Mbo II, while H37Rv strain and the other 32 strains with SM MICs of < 256 micrograms/ml were cut into 2 fragments. In conclusion, our results suggest that highly SM-resistant M.tuberculosis strains with MICs of > or = 256 micrograms/ml could be rapidly and easily detected by the restriction enzymatic method.
9380737	Transformation with human dihydrofolate reductase renders malaria parasites insensitive to WR99210 but does not affect the intrinsic activity of proguanil.	Increasing resistance of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites to chloroquine and the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors pyrimethamine and cycloguanil have sparked renewed interest in the antimalarial drugs WR99210 and proguanil, the cycloguanil precursor. To investigate suggestions that WR99210 and proguanil act against a target other than the reductase moiety of the P. falciparum bifunctional DHFR-thymidylate synthase enzyme, we have transformed P. falciparum with a variant form of human DHFR selectable by methotrexate. Human DHFR was found to fully negate the antiparasitic effect of WR99210, thus demonstrating that the only significant action of WR99210 is against parasite DHFR. Although the human enzyme also resulted in greater resistance to cycloguanil, no decrease was found in the level of susceptibility of transformed parasites to proguanil, thus providing evidence of intrinsic activity of this parent compound against a target other than DHFR. The transformation system described here has the advantage that P. falciparum drug-resistant lines are uniformly sensitive to methotrexate and will complement transformation with existing pyrimethamine-resistance markers in functional studies of P. falciparum genes. This system also provides an approach for screening and identifying novel DHFR inhibitors that will be important in combined chemotherapeutic formulations against malaria.
9387868	Serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporter mRNAs: heterogeneity of distribution and response to 'binge' cocaine administration.	Quantitative in situ hybridization was utilized to map the distribution and abundance of the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporter (SERT, DAT and NET, respectively) mRNAs. SERT mRNA was quantified within the dorsal raphe (DR) and the median raphe (MR), DAT mRNA within the ventral tegmental area -substantia nigra (VTA-SN) region and NET mRNA within the locus coeruleus (LC). SERT mRNA expression within the raphe complex was organized into distinct subregional domains with the rank order of mRNA abundance: ventromedial (vm) DR > dorsomedial (dm) DR > MR > dorsolateral (dl) DR. The relative abundance of DAT mRNA also varied across subregions: SN pars compacta > the parabrachial pigmentosis (PBP) > the intrafascicular (IF). The effects of a 'binge' paradigm of cocaine administration on SERT, DAT and NET mRNA abundance were compared in the brains of behaviorally sensitized rats. Cocaine significantly decreased the abundance of the SERT mRNA within the dlDR and DAT mRNA abundance within the SNc and the PBP, and increased the abundance of the NET mRNA within the LC. Finally, correlational analysis indicated that post-cocaine levels of DAT, SERT and NET mRNAs were not associated with cocaine-induced sensitization.
9422361	In vivo electrochemical studies of dopamine clearance in the rat substantia nigra: effects of locally applied uptake inhibitors and unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions.	High-speed chronoamperometric recordings were used to measure the uptake and clearance of locally applied dopamine (DA) within the substantia nigra (SN) of anesthetized rats. To establish that DA clearance within the SN was mediated primarily by the DA transporter (DAT) rather than the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or the serotonin transporter (SERT), we locally applied uptake inhibitors with different selectivity profiles for the various amine transporters. Nomifensine, a DAT/NET inhibitor, significantly potentiated both the amplitude and the time course of the DA signals. In contrast, neither the selective NET inhibitor desipramine, nor the selective SERT inhibitor citalopram affected the DA signal, suggesting that NET and SERT do not contribute to DA uptake and clearance within the regions of the SN studied over the concentration ranges (1-5 microM) used. In unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, the time course of the DA signal was increased in both the lesioned SN and striatum, relative to the unlesioned hemisphere, indicating loss of DAT and decreased DA uptake and clearance. In addition, when identical amounts of DA were injected in the striatum and SN, peak signal amplitudes were larger in the SN, suggesting that the amplitudes are related to the number of DAT sites in a given region of brain tissue. For signals of equivalent amplitudes, clearance rates were lower in the SN than in the striatum, consistent with a lower capacity for DAT-mediated DA uptake within the SN. These results suggest that the DAT is the major transporter responsible for DA clearance within the rat SN.
9439778	Effect of potassium channel openers on the firing rate of hippocampal pyramidal cells and A10 dopaminergic neurons in vitro.	The effect of four KATP channel openers (KCOs) on the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells and A10 dopaminergic neurons was investigated using extracellular recording techniques in rat brain slices. Pinacidil, lemakalim, diazoxide and a new compound, BPDZ44, had an inhibitory effect on the electrical activity of CA1 pyramidal cells. They all had a similar potency. Only BPDZ44 and diazoxide inhibited the firing rate of A10 dopamine neurons. The sulfonylurea glipizide (1 microM) antagonized the effect of BPDZ44 and diazoxide on A10 neurons but failed to antagonize the effect of KCOs on CA1 pyramidal cells. These results show that differences exist among KCOs in their ability to decrease the electrical activity of various populations of central neurons.
9454790	Pharmacological comparison of the cloned human and rat M2 muscarinic receptor genes expressed in the murine fibroblast (B82) cell line.	The coding sequence of the human m2 receptor gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and stably transfected into a murine fibroblast cell line (B82). We have compared the human M2 clonal cell line (HM2-B10) with the previously established B82 cell line (M2LKB2-2) expressing the rat M2 receptor to assess drug specificity, drug selectivity and effector coupling. Both transfected cell lines showed a high level of specific, saturable [3H](-)-N-methyl-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding with Kd values of 243 pM (155-352 pM) and 345 pM (234-539 pM) and Bmax values of 97 +/- 4 and 338 +/- 16 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. Inhibition of [3H](-)-N-methyl-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to HM2-B10 cells and M2LKB2-2 cells showed the same rank order of potency for the antagonists: atropine > dexetimide > 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide > himbacine > methoctramine > 11-[[2-[(diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihidro-6H-pyrido-[2,3-b](1, 4)-benzodiazepine-6-one > hexahydro-sila-difenidol hydro-chloride > pirenzepine. Correlation analysis of the pKi values indicate that the expressed human and rat M2 receptors have nearly identical ligand-binding characteristics. Carbachol inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation with similar potency in both cell lines [EC50 = 2.4 microM (0.2-2.8) and 1.1 microM (0.2-5.3) for the human and rat M2 receptor, respectively]. In the M2LKB2-2 cells, carbachol slightly stimulated the [3H]inositol monophosphate formation but had no significant effect in HM2-B10 cells. In conclusion, the human and rat M2 receptors expressed in the B82 cell line have very similar binding properties but exhibit slight differences in effector coupling mechanisms.
9506845	Calorimetric analysis of lisinopril binding to angiotensin I-converting enzyme.	Isothermal titration microcalorimetry has been used to measure changes in enthalpy and heat capacity for binding of lisinopril to the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) and to its apoenzyme at pH 7.5 over a temperature range of 15-30 degrees C. Calorimetric measurements indicate that lisinopril binds to two sites in the monomer of both holo- and apo-ACE. Binding of lisinopril to both systems is enthalpically unfavorable and, thus, is dominated by a large positive entropy change. The enthalpy change of binding is strongly temperature-dependent for both holo- and apo-ACE, arising from a large heat capacity change of binding equal to -2.4 +/- 0.2 kJ/K/mol of monomeric holo-ACE) and to -1.9 +/- 0.2 kJ/K/mol of monomeric apo-ACE), respectively. The negative values of deltaCp for both systems are consistent with burial of a large non-polar surface area upon binding. Although the binding of lisinopril to holo- and apo-ACE is favored by entropy changes, this is more positive for the holoenzyme. Thus, the interaction between Zn2+ and lisinopril results in a higher affinity of the holoenzyme for this drug due to a more favorable entropic contribution.
9541386	Structures of murine carbonic anhydrase IV and human carbonic anhydrase II complexed with brinzolamide: molecular basis of isozyme-drug discrimination.	Carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) is a membrane-associated enzyme anchored to plasma membrane surfaces by a phosphatidylinositol glycan linkage. We have determined the 2.8-angstroms resolution crystal structure of a truncated, soluble form of recombinant murine CAIV. We have also determined the structure of its complex with a drug used for glaucoma therapy, the sulfonamide inhibitor brinzolamide (Azopt). The overall structure of murine CAIV is generally similar to that of human CAIV; however, some local structural differences are found in the active site resulting from amino acid sequence differences in the "130's segment" and the residue-63 loop (these may affect the nearby catalytic proton shuttle, His-64). Similar to human CAIV, the C-terminus of murine CAIV is surrounded by a substantial electropositive surface potential that may stabilize the interaction with the phospholipid membrane. Binding interactions observed for brinzolamide rationalize the generally weaker affinity of inhibitors used in glaucoma therapy toward CAIV compared with CAII.
9564606	Differential trace amine alterations in individuals receiving acetylenic inhibitors of MAO-A (clorgyline) or MAO-B (selegiline and pargyline).	Marked, dose-dependent elevations in the urinary excretion of phenylethylamine, para-tyramine, and meta-tyramine were observed in depressed patients treated for three or more weeks with 10, 30, or 60 mg/day of the partially-selective inhibitor of MAO-B, selegiline (l-deprenyl). In comparative studies with other, structurally similar acetylenic inhibitors of MAO, pargyline, an MAO-B > MAO-A inhibitor used in doses of 90 mg/day for three or more weeks, produced elevations in these trace amines which were similar to those found with the highest dose of selegiline studied. Clorgyline, a selective inhibitor of MAO-A used in doses of 30 mg/day for three or more weeks (a dose/time regimen previously reported to reduce urinary, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) > 80%, indicating a marked inhibitory effect on MAO-A in humans in vivo) produced negligible changes in trace amine excretion. In comparison to recent studies of individuals lacking the genes for MAO-A, MAO-B, or both MAO-A and MAO-B, the lack of change in trace amine excretion in individuals with a mutation affecting only MAO-A is in agreement with the observed lack of effect of clorgyline in the present study. Selegiline produced larger changes in trace amines--at least at the higher doses studied--than found in individuals lacking the gene for MAO-B, in agreement with other data suggesting a lesser selectivity for MAO-B inhibition when selegiline was given in doses higher than 10 mg/day. Overall, trace amine elevations in individuals receiving the highest dose of deprenyl or receiving pargyline were approximately three to five-fold lower than the elevations observed in individuals lacking the genes for both MAO-A and MAO-B, suggesting that these drug doses yield incomplete inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B.
9570326	Allylamine and beta-aminopropionitrile induced aortic medial necrosis: mechanisms of synergism.	We have developed a model of aortic smooth muscle necrosis in adult Sprague Dawley rats by feeding them two vascular toxins (allylamine HCl, or AA, and beta-aminopropionitrile, or betaAPN) in concert for 10 days. Either toxin given alone does not cause aortic lesions. In order to shed light on the mechanism of the synergistic action of these two toxins we fed known modulators of AA or betaAPN toxicity to rats concurrently with the two toxins. As modulators we used (a) semicarbazide (98 mg/kg/day, given 4 h prior to toxins), a known inhibitor of the vascular enzyme SSAO which metabolizes AA; (b) L-cysteine (1.5% in rat chow, beginning 3 days prior to toxins), which has been shown to reduce the toxic effects of betaAPN; and (c) phenelzine sulphate (3 mg/kg/day, given 4 h prior to toxins), an inhibitor of SSAO and potentiator of betaAPN toxicity. Rats were fed various combinations of the toxins and modulators by gavage: water (n = 8); (AA, 100 mg/kg/day) AA + phenelzine (n = 8); AA + semicarbazide (n = 8); AA + L-cysteine (n = 11); (betaAPN, 1 g/kg/day) betaAPN + phenelzine (n = 8); betaAPN + semicarbazide (n = 8); betaAPN + L-cysteine (n = 8); (AA, 100 mg + betaAPN, 1 g/kg/day) AA + betaAPN + phenelzine (n = 9), AA + betaAPN + semicarbazide (n = 8); AA + betaAPN + L-cysteine (n = 12); phenelzine (3 mg/kg/day) (n = 4); semicarbazide (98 mg/kg/day) (n = 4) and L-cysteine (1.5% in rat chow) (n = 4). We found that phenelzine sulphate (a drug previously used in the treatment of hypertension) when given with AA reproduced the AA + betaAPN induced aortic lesions. Phenelzine + betaAPN caused no lesions, but when combined with AA + betaAPN, aortic lesions were intensified and included marked secondary degeneration of the vascular wall. Semicarbazide was found to completely obviate the vascular toxicity of AA + betaAPN. L-Cysteine feeding markedly decreased the incidence and severity of vascular lesions in AA + betaAPN treated rats, but did not change the incidence or severity of heart lesions caused by AA alone. These data indicate that the synergistic necrotizing toxicity of AA + betaAPN is primarily an AA effect. We postulate that some modulating influence of betaAPN (or phenelzine) on tissue distribution, metabolism, or detoxification pathways of AA increases AA's acute vascular toxicity, whereas semicarbazide offers protection by inhibiting the initial deamination of AA to a highly reactive aldehyde.
9572299	Modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor by haloperidol: NR2B-specific interactions.	The dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol has an eight- to 10-fold higher affinity for NMDA receptors containing the NR2B (epsilon2) subunit, showing the same subunit specificity as ifenprodil, polyamines, and magnesium. In the present study, we have compared the effects of mutations altering polyamine and ifenprodil sensitivity on haloperidol sensitivity of NMDA receptors. As seen for spermidine stimulation, high-affinity haloperidol inhibition is governed by the region around amino acid 198, based on results from chimeric murine NR2A/NR2B (epislon1/epsilon2) receptors. Mutation of epsilon2E201 in this region to asparagine or arginine causes a 10-fold decrease in the ability of haloperidol to inhibit 125I-MK-801 binding. Epsilon2E201 does not govern the interactions of ifenprodil, because all of the mutants at epsilon2E201 exhibited wild-type affinity for ifenprodil. Mutation of epsilon2R337 causes a 400-fold loss in apparent affinity for ifenprodil but does not change the effects of haloperidol. The structural determinants of spermidine stimulation do not perfectly match those for haloperidol inhibition, as mutations of E200 remove haloperidol inhibition but do not alter polyamine stimulation. The present results thus demonstrate that although spermidine, haloperidol, and ifenprodil share subunit selectivity and overlapping pharmacology, they also have specific structural determinants.
9602957	The effects of eprosartan, an angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, on uric acid excretion in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.	The effects of antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin II receptor antagonists, on urine uric acid excretion may have important clinical consequences. Therefore, the effects of single and repeated doses of eprosartan on uric acid excretion were evaluated in 57 male patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, repeated dose, dose-rising, two-period, period-balanced, crossover study conducted in two parts. In part 1 (n = 33), the effects of eprosartan dose regimens of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 350 mg once daily and 150 mg every 12 hours on uric acid excretion were assessed. In part 2 (n = 24), the effects of eprosartan dose regimens of 600 mg, 800 mg, and 1,200 mg once daily on uric acid excretion were assessed. Eprosartan was well tolerated. There were no appreciable changes from predose values in fractional excretion of uric acid (FEua), urine uric acid excretion, urine uric acid to creatinine (Uua/Ucr) ratios, or serum uric acid concentrations after single or repeated doses of eprosartan. Mean Uua/Ucr ratios for eprosartan doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 350 mg daily or 150 mg every 12 hours were comparable to those for placebo. Mean FEua values and Uua/Ucr ratios for eprosartan doses of 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1,200 mg daily also were comparable to those for placebo. Single and repeated oral doses of eprosartan ranging from 50 mg to 1,200 mg daily had no effect on serum uric acid concentrations or urine uric acid excretion in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.
9605573	Agonistic properties of alniditan, sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine on human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors expressed in various mammalian cell lines.	1. Alniditan, a novel migraine abortive agent, is a potent 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor agonist of nM affinity. We compared the agonistic properties of alniditan, sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine on the cloned human 5-HT1B receptor expressed at 200 fmol mg(-1) protein (Bmax) in non-induced L929sA cells, at 740 fmol mg(-1) protein in HEK 293 and at 2300 fmol mg(-1) protein in mIFNbeta-induced L929sA cells, and on the human cloned 5-HT1D receptor expressed in C6 glioma cells (Bmax 780 fmol mg(-1) protein). 2. Sodium butyrate treatment increased the expression level of human (h)5-HT1B receptors in HEK 293 cells and h5-HT1D receptors in C6 glioma cells approximately 3 fold, the binding affinities of [3H]-5-HT and [3H]-alniditan were unaffected. 3. Agonistic properties were evaluated based on inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in the cells after stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin or isoproterenol. Alniditan, sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine were full agonists at the hS-HT1B receptor (IC50 values were 1.7, 20 and 2 nM, respectively in HEK 293 cells) and hS-HT1D receptors (IC50 values of 1.3, 2.6 and 2.2 nM, respectively). At the h5-HT1B receptor the agonist potency of the compounds slightly increased with higher receptor density. The opposite was seen for antagonists (ocaperidone, risperidone and ritanserin). 4. This comparative study demonstrated that alniditan was 10 times more potent than sumatriptan at the h5-HT1B receptor, and twice as potent at the h5-HT1D receptor. Dihydroergotamine was more potent an agonist at the h5-HT1B receptor when expressed at high and low level in L929sA cells (but not in HEK 293 cells), and was less potent at the hS-HT1D receptor.
9647463	Molecular cloning and characterization of rat P2Y4 nucleotide receptor.	An intronless open reading frame encoding a protein (361aa in length) was isolated from a rat genomic library probed with a DNA fragment from rat heart. This protein showed 83% sequence identity with the human P2Y4 (hP2Y4) receptor and represents a homologue of the human pyrimidinoceptor. However, the rP2Y4 receptor is not selective for uridine nucleotides and, instead, shows an agonist potency order of ITP = ATP = ADP(pure) = UTP = ATPgammaS = 2-MeSATP = Ap4A > UDP(pure). ADP, ATPgammaS, 2-MeSATP and UDP are partial agonists. Thus, in terms of agonist profile, rP2Y4 is more like the P2U receptor subtype. The rP2Y4 receptor was reversibly antagonized by Reactive blue 2 but not by suramin which, otherwise, inhibits the hP2Y2 receptor (a known P2U receptor). Thus, rP2Y4 and the P2Y2 subtype appear to be structurally distinct forms of the P2U receptor (where ATP and UTP are equi-active) but can be distinguished as suramin-insensitive and suramin-sensitive P2U receptors, respectively.
9648873	Lobeline displaces [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding and releases [3H]dopamine from rat striatal synaptic vesicles: comparison with d-amphetamine.	Lobeline, an alkaloid from Indian tobacco (Lobelia inflata), is classified as a nicotinic agonist and is currently used as a smoking cessation agent. However, our previous in vitro studies demonstrate that lobeline does not act as a nicotinic agonist but alters presynaptic dopamine (DA) storage by potently inhibiting DA uptake into synaptic vesicles. Recently, d-amphetamine has been reported to act at the level of the synaptic vesicle to alter presynaptic function. The present in vitro studies further elucidate the mechanism of lobeline's action and compare its effects with those of d-amphetamine. [3H]Dihydrotetrabenazine ([3H]DTBZ), used routinely to probe a high-affinity binding site on the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), bound to vesicle membranes from rat striatum with a KD of 1.67 nM and Bmax of 8.68 pmol/mg of protein. Lobeline inhibited [3H]DTBZ binding with an IC50 of 0.90 microM, consistent with its previously reported IC50 of 0.88 microM for inhibition of [3H]DA uptake into vesicles. These results suggest that lobeline specifically interacts with DTBZ sites on VMAT2 to inhibit DA uptake into synaptic vesicles. Interestingly, d-amphetamine inhibited [3H]DTBZ binding to vesicle membranes with an IC50 of 39.4 microM, a concentration 20 times greater than reported for inhibition of VMAT2 function, suggesting that d-amphetamine interacts with a different site than lobeline on VMAT2 to inhibit monoamine uptake. Kinetic analysis of [3H]DA release from [3H]DA-preloaded synaptic vesicles in the absence of drug revealed a t1/2 of 2.12 min. Lobeline and d-amphetamine evoked [3H]DA release with EC50 values of 25.3 and 2.22 microM, respectively. At a concentration 10 times the EC50, lobeline and d-amphetamine significantly decreased the t1/2 of [3H]DA release to 1.58 and 1.48 min, respectively. Thus, in contrast to d-amphetamine, which is equipotent in inhibiting DA uptake and promoting release from the synaptic vesicles, lobeline more potently (28-fold) inhibits DA uptake (via an interaction with the DTBZ site on VMAT2) than it evokes DA release to redistribute presynaptic DA storage.
9650800	Interaction of 5-HT1B/D ligands with recombinant h 5-HT1A receptors: intrinsic activity and modulation by G-protein activation state.	Many 5-HT1B/D receptor ligands have affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. In the present study, the intrinsic activity of a series of 5-HT1B/D ligands was investigated at human 5-HT1A (h 5-HT1A) receptors by measuring G-protein activation in recombinant C6-glial and HeLa membranes, using agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding. In these two membrane preparations, the density of h 5-HT1A receptors (i.e., 246 to 320 fmol mg(-1) protein) and of their G-proteins, and the receptor: G-protein density ratio (0.08 to 0.18) appeared to be similar. It was found that: (i) the maximal [35S]GTPgammaS binding responses induced by the 5-HT1B/D receptor ligands in the HeLa preparation at 30 microM GDP were comparable to that of the native agonist 5-HT; (ii) as compared to 5-HT (1.00), similar potencies but lower maximal responses were observed in the C6-glial preparation at 0.3 microM GDP for zolmitriptan (0.89), dihydroergotamine (0.81), rizatriptan (0.71), CP122638 (0.69), naratriptan (0.60) and sumatriptan (0.53); and that (iii) maximal [35S]GTPgammaS binding responses induced by 5-HT1B/D ligands in the C6-glial preparation were either unaffected or significantly enhanced by increasing the GDP concentration from 0.3 to 30 microM and higher concentrations. These features differ from those observed with 5-HT1A receptor agonists; the latter display the same rank order of potency and efficacy in both membrane preparations, and increasing the amount of GDP with C6-glial membranes results in an attenuation of both the agonist's maximal effect and the apparent potency of partial agonists. The differential regulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D agonist responses by GDP suggests that different G-protein subtypes are involved upon 5-HT1A receptor activation by 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D agonists.
9685234	4H-1,2,4-Pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides and 2,3-dihydro-4H-1,2, 4-pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides chemically related to diazoxide and cyclothiazide as powerful positive allosteric modulators of (R/S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid receptors: design, synthesis, pharmacology, and structure-activity relationships.	A series of 4H-1,2,4-pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides and 2, 3-dihydro-4H-1,2,4-pyridothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides bearing various alkyl and aryl substituents on the 2-, 3-, and 4-positions was synthesized and tested as possible positive allosteric modulators of the (R/S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Many compounds were found to be more potent than the reference compounds diazoxide and aniracetam as potentiators of the AMPA current in rat cortex mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. The most active compound, 4-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-4H-pyrido[3,2-e]-1,2, 4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (31b), revealed an in vitro activity on Xenopus oocytes not far from that of cyclothiazide, the most potent allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors reported to date. Moreover, 31b, but not cyclothiazide, was found to potentiate the duration and the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic field potentials induced by electric stimulation in rat hippocampal slices. Such an effect could indicate, for 31b, but not for cyclothiazide, a possible interaction with postsynaptic AMPA receptor binding sites located on hippocampal CA1 neurons. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the structural requirements responsible for a biological activity on AMPA receptors are different from those responsible for an inhibitory activity on the insulin releasing process (putative ATP-sensitive K+-channel openers). For instance, 31b and other related dihydropyridothiadiazines were found to be ineffective as inhibitors of insulin release from rat pancreatic B-cells, in contrast to diazoxide and known pyridothiadiazines reported as ATP-sensitive K+-channel openers. Conversely, the pyridothiadiazines active on B-cells were found to be ineffective as potentiators of the AMPA currents in Xenopus oocytes. Thus, 31b appeared to be more specific than diazoxide as an AMPA receptor modulator. This compound may be considered as a new pharmacological tool, different from diazoxide and cyclothiazide, for studying AMPA receptors. Moreover, 31b can also constitute a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of cognitive disorders.
9685354	Coordinated action of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in antineoplastic drug detoxification. Mechanism of GST A1-1- and MRP1-associated resistance to chlorambucil in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells.	To examine the role of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in cellular resistance to antineoplastic drugs, derivatives of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were developed that express MRP1 in combination with one of three human cytosolic isozymes of GST. Expression of MRP1 alone confers resistance to several drugs representing the multidrug resistance phenotype, drugs including doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and mitoxantrone. However, co-expression with MRP1 of any of the human GST isozymes A1-1, M1-1, or P1-1 failed to augment MRP1-associated resistance to these drugs. In contrast, combined expression of MRP1 and GST A1-1 conferred approximately 4-fold resistance to the anticancer drug chlorambucil. Expression of MRP1 alone failed to confer resistance to chlorambucil, showing that the observed protection from chlorambucil cytotoxicity was absolutely dependent upon GST A1-1 protein. Moreover, using inhibitors of GST (dicumarol) or MRP1 (sulfinpyrazone), it was shown that in MCF7 cells resistance to chlorambucil requires both intact MRP1-dependent efflux pump activity and, for full protection, GST A1-1 catalytic activity. These results are the first demonstration that GST A1-1 and MRP1 can act in synergy to protect cells from the cytotoxicity of a nitrogen mustard, chlorambucil.
9694935	The antipsychotic agent sertindole is a high affinity antagonist of the human cardiac potassium channel HERG.	Acquired long QT syndrome is a side effect seen with some pharmacological agents, including antipsychotic drugs, and is associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias. This syndrome is often caused by the blockade of repolarizing potassium channels the human heart. A new antipsychotic agent, sertindole, has been shown to produce QT prolongation after therapeutic doses in humans. We therefore examined the effects of sertindole on two cloned human cardiac potassium channels, the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) and Kv1.5, stably transfected into mammalian cell lines. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we found sertindole blocked HERG currents with an IC50 value of 14.0 nM when tail currents at -40 mV were measured after a 2-sec depolarization to +20 mV. When currents were measured at the end of prolonged (20 sec) depolarizing pulses, the IC50 of sertindole measured 2.99 nM. Sertindole enhanced the rate of current decay during these prolonged voltage steps and displayed a positive voltage dependence. Sertindole was approximately 1000-fold less active at blocking Kv1.5 displaying an IC50 value of 2.12 microM. By comparison, the potent class III antiarrhythmic agent dofetilde blocked HERG with an IC50 value of 9.50 nM but did not enhance HERG current decay or block Kv1. 5 channel currents. It is concluded that sertindole is a high affinity antagonist of the human cardiac potassium channel HERG and that this blockade underlies the prolongation of QT interval observed with this drug. Furthermore, the sertindole molecule may provide a useful starting point for the development of very high affinity ligands for HERG.
9712836	S100A13 is involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor-1 and p40 synaptotagmin-1 release in vitro.	We have previously characterized the release of the signal peptide sequence-less fibroblast growth factor (FGF) prototype, FGF-1, in vitro as a stress-induced pathway in which FGF-1 is released as a latent homodimer with the p40 extravesicular domain of p65 synaptotagmin (Syn)-1. To determine the biologic relevance of the FGF-1 release pathway in vivo, we sought to resolve and characterize from ovine brain a purified fraction that contained both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 and report that the brain-derived FGF-1:p40 Syn-1 aggregate is associated with the calcium-binding protein, S100A13. Since S100A13 binds the anti-inflammatory compound amlexanox and FGF-1 is involved in inflammation, we examined the effects of amlexanox on the release of FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 in response to stress in vitro. We report that while amlexanox was able to repress the heat shock-induced release of FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, it had no effect on the constitutive release of p40 Syn-1 from p40 Syn-1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. These data suggest the following: (i) FGF-1 is associated with Syn-1 and S100A13 in vivo; (ii) S100A13 may be involved in the regulation of FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 release in response to temperature stress in vitro; and (iii) the FGF-1 release pathway may be accessible to pharmacologic regulation.
9733584	Effect of latanoprost on the extracellular matrix of the ciliary muscle. A study on cultured cells and tissue sections.	Prostaglandin F2alpha and its analogue latanoprost, both prostanoid FP receptor agonists, reduce the intraocular pressure mainly by enhancing uveoscleral outflow. Changes in the extracellular matrix of the ciliary muscle may be involved in the increased outflow. The effect of latanoprost and prostaglandin F2alpha on the extracellular matrix of the ciliary muscle was investigated. Cell cultures of human ciliary muscle were treated with latanoprost acid or prostaglandin F2alpha for 1-2 days and were immunostained against various extracellular matrix components and metalloproteinases. Proteinases were also analysed by zymography and by measuring plasmin generating ability. For comparison, matrix components were immunolocalized on tissue sections from monkey eyes, treated topically once daily with latanoprost for 10 days. In response to both prostaglandins collagens I, III, and IV, fibronectin, laminin and hyaluronan were reduced, while metalloproteinase -2 and -3 were increased. Zymography demonstrated the presence of functionally active metalloproteinase -2. Both prostaglandins enhanced the generation of plasmin, an activator of metalloproteinases. In the anterior part of the ciliary muscle in latanoprost-treated eyes immunostained collagen VI was decreased in 5 out of 5 monkeys and collagen IV was decreased in 4 of the 5 monkeys. These results suggest a role for latanoprost in the remodeling of extracellular matrix in the ciliary muscle. A latanoprost-induced change in the extracellular matrix might augment the flow of aqueous humour through the ciliary muscle bundles of the uveoscleral pathway.
9740313	Autoradiographic imaging of formaldehyde adducts in mice: possible relevance for vascular damage in diabetes.	The activity of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) has been reported to be elevated in blood from diabetic patients. It has been suggested that the enzyme is involved in the development of complications such as retinopathies, nephropathies and neuropathies, which are associated with advanced diabetes, possibly by the formation of toxic metabolites. Under the influence of SSAO, methylamine is deaminated to formaldehyde which is known to react with various macromolecules. It has therefore been proposed that specific inhibition of SSAO could be of therapeutic value for treatment of diabetic patients. The present results provide evidence that treatment with an SSAO inhibitor potently reduces the levels of irreversible adducts. In this study, 14C-methylamine was given intraperitoneally to NMRI mice, and the tissue distribution of irreversibly bound methylamine metabolites was estimated by an autoradiographic method. Such radioactive residues occurred in high concentrations in the intestinal wall, brown adipose tissue, spleen and bone marrow. By inhibiting SSAO irreversibly with hydralazine before giving 14C-methylamine to the mice, it was possible to determine the resynthesis rate of SSAO in different tissues. A complete recovery of SSAO activity was seen in the intestinal wall after 6 days, whereas only about 60% was recovered in adipose tissue after 14 days. This suggests that factors controlling the synthesis of SSAO differ in these tissues, or that these tissues express different forms of enzymes.
9765513	HERG and KvLQT1/IsK, the cardiac K+ channels involved in long QT syndromes, are targets for calcium channel blockers.	We examined the effects of the calcium channel blockers nitrendipine, diltiazem, verapamil, bepridil, and mibefradil on the cloned HERG and KvLQT1/IsK K+ channels. These channels generate the rapid and slow components of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, and mutations can affect them, which leads to long QT syndromes. When expressed in transfected COS cells, HERG is blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by bepridil (EC50 = 0.55 microM), verapamil (EC50 = 0.83 microM), and mibefradil (EC50 = 1.43 microM), whereas nitrendipine and diltiazem have negligible effects. Steady state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more negative values in the presence of the blockers. Similarly, KvLQT1/IsK is inhibited by bepridil (EC50 = 10.0 microM) and mibefradil (EC50 = 11.8 microM), while being insensitive to nitrendipine, diltiazem, or verapamil. These results demonstrate that both cloned K+ channels HERG and KvLQT1/IsK, which represent together the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, are sensitive targets to calcium channel blockers. This work may help in understanding the mechanisms of action of verapamil in certain ventricular tachycardia, as well as some of the deleterious adverse cardiac events associated with bepridil.
9806333	Analysis of the 5-HT1A receptor involvement in passive avoidance in the rat.	1. The effects of the 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOB, the selective 5-HT1A agonist NDO 008 (3-dipropylamino-5-hydroxychroman), and the two enantiomers of the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (R(+)-8-OH-DPAT and S(-)-8-OH-DPAT) were studied in a step-through passive avoidance (PA) test in the male rat. 2. The 5-HT1A agonists injected prior to training (conditioning) produced a dose-dependent impairment of PA retention when examined 24 h later. R(+)-8-OH-DPAT was four times more effective than S(-)-8-OH-DPAT to cause an impairment of PA retention. Both NDO 008 and the two enantiomers of 8-OH-DPAT induced the serotonin syndrome at the dose range that produced inhibition of the PA response, thus, indicating activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. 3. Neither NDO 008 nor R(+)-8-OH-DPAT induced head-twitches, a behavioural response attributed to stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors. In contrast, DOB induced head-twitches at the 0.01 mg kg(-1) dose while a 200 times higher dose was required to produce a significant impairment of PA retention. 4. The impairment of PA retention induced by both NDO 008 and R(+)-8-OH-DPAT was fully blocked by the active S(+)- enantiomer of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100135 and the mixed 5-HT1A/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist L(-)-alprenolol. In contrast, the mixed 5-HT2A/2C antagonists ketanserin and pirenperone were found to be ineffective. Moreover, the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551, the beta-antagonist metoprolol as well as the mixed beta-adrenoceptor blocker D(+)-alprenolol all failed to modify the deficit of PA retention by NDO 008 and R(+)-8-OH-DPAT. None of the 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists tested or the beta-blockers altered PA retention by themselves. 5. A 3 day pretreatment procedure (200+100+100 mg kg(-1)) with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) did not alter PA retention and did not prevent the inhibitory action of the 5-HT1A agonists, indicating that their effects on PA do not depend on endogenous 5-HT. 6. The effects of NDO 008 on PA were also studied using a state-dependent learning paradigm. NDO 008 was found to produce a disruption of PA when given either prior to training or retention or both prior to training and retention but it failed to affect PA retention when given immediately after training. .7 These findings indicate that the deficit of passive avoidance retention induced by the 5-HT1A agonists is mainly a result of stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors but not 5-HT2A receptors. The 5-HT1A receptor stimulation appears to interfere with learning processes operating at both acquisition and retrieval.
9822768	Long-term antidepressant treatments result in a tonic activation of forebrain 5-HT1A receptors.	We report here the first direct functional evidence of an increase in the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors by antidepressant treatments. Because 5-HT1A receptor activation hyperpolarizes and inhibits CA3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, we determined, using in vivo extracellular recording, whether the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 could disinhibit these neurons. Unexpectedly, no disinhibition could be detected in controls. However, after long-term treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, the reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor befloxatone, the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist mirtazapine, or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist gepirone or multiple electroconvulsive shock (ECS) administration, WAY 100635 markedly increased (60-200%) the firing activity of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Such a disinhibition was absent in rats treated with the nonantidepressant drug chlorpromazine, in rats receiving only one ECS, or in rats receiving multiple ECSs in combination with an intrahippocampal pertussis toxin treatment to inactivate Gi/o-coupled 5-HT1A receptors. These data indicate that such antidepressant treatments, acting on entirely different primary targets, might alleviate depression by enhancing the tonic activation of forebrain postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.
9885294	The human multidrug resistance protein MRP1 translocates sphingolipid analogs across the plasma membrane.	Recently, we have provided evidence that the ABC-transporter MDR1 P-glycoprotein translocates analogs of various lipid classes across the apical plasma membrane of polarized LLC-PK1 cells transfected with MDR1 cDNA. Here, we show that expression of the basolateral ABC-transporter MRP1 (the multidrug resistance protein) induced lipid transport to the exoplasmic leaflet of the basolateral plasma membrane of LLC-PK1 cells at 15 degreesC. C6-NBD-glucosylceramide synthesized on the cytosolic side of the Golgi complex, but not C6-NBD-sphingomyelin synthesized in the Golgi lumen, became accessible to depletion by BSA in the basal culture medium. This suggests the absence of vesicular traffic and direct translocation of C6-NBD-glucosylceramide by MRP1 across the basolateral membrane. In line with this, transport of the lipid to the exoplasmic leaflet depended on the intracellular glutathione concentration and was inhibited by the MRP1-inhibitors sulfinpyrazone and indomethacin, but not by the MDR1 P-glycoprotein inhibitor PSC 833. In contrast to the broad substrate specificity of the MDR1 P-glycoprotein, MRP1 selectively transported C6-NBD-glucosylceramide and C6-NBD-sphingomyelin, the latter only when it was released from the Golgi lumen by brefeldin A. This shows the specific nature of the lipid translocation. We conclude that the transport activity of MDR1 P-glycoprotein and MRP1 must be taken into account in studies on the transport of lipids to the cell surface.
9886939	Bumetanide blocks CFTR GCl in the native sweat duct.	Bumetanide is well known for its ability to inhibit the nonconductive Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter. We were surprised in preliminary studies to find that bumetanide in the contraluminal bath also inhibited NaCl absorption in the human sweat duct, which is apparently poor in cotransporter activity. Inhibition was accompanied by a marked decrease in the transepithelial electrical conductance. Because the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel is richly expressed in the sweat duct, we asked whether bumetanide acts by blocking this anion channel. We found that bumetanide 1) significantly increased whole cell input impedance, 2) hyperpolarized transepithelial and basolateral membrane potentials, 3) depolarized apical membrane potential, 4) increased the ratio of apical-to-basolateral membrane resistance, and 5) decreased transepithelial Cl- conductance (GCl). These results indicate that bumetanide inhibits CFTR GCl in both cell membranes of this epithelium. We excluded bumetanide interference with the protein kinase A phosphorylation activation process by "irreversibly" phosphorylating CFTR [by using adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in the presence of a phosphatase inhibition cocktail] before bumetanide application. We then activated CFTR GCl by adding 5 mM ATP. Bumetanide in the cytoplasmic bath (10(-3) M) inhibited approximately 71% of this ATP-activated CFTR GCl, indicating possible direct inhibition of CFTR GCl. We conclude that bumetanide inhibits CFTR GCl in apical and basolateral membranes independent of phosphorylation. The results also suggest that >10(-5) M bumetanide cannot be used to specifically block the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter.
9892163	Renal responses of the nonclipped kidney of two-kidney/one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats to type 1 angiotensin II receptor blockade with candesartan.	Recent studies with normal rats indicated that systemic administration of the angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker candesartan elicited divergent renal hemodynamic and excretory responses depending on the magnitude of associated decreases in mean arterial pressure. To evaluate the responses to candesartan in hypertensive rats, experiments were performed 25 d after unilateral renal arterial constriction with a 0.25-mm clip. The rats were anesthetized and prepared for acute clearance experiments. Control arterial pressure responses to a bolus AngII dose (50 ng) averaged 35+/-7 mmHg; the control decreases in cortical renal blood flow (RBF), measured with laser Doppler flowmetry, were 58+/-9%. The vasoconstrictor responses to AngII were abolished by candesartan doses of 1 and 0.1 mg/kg. Treatment with 0.01 mg/kg candesartan attenuated the arterial pressure responses but did not prevent the cortical RBF decreases. The highest dose of candesartan (1 mg/kg) elicited rapid reductions in arterial pressure (from 154+/-5 to 122+/-9 mmHg), leading to associated decreases in RBF (from 5.5+/-0.2 to 4.6+/-0.4 ml/min x g) and sodium excretion (from 0.4+/-0.1 to 0.2+/-0.1 microEq/min x g). The 0.1 mg/kg dose of candesartan led to gradual reductions in arterial pressure (from 155+/-5 to 140+/-5 mmHg), and there were significant increases in RBF (from 5.4+/-0.2 to 6.8+/-0.4 ml/min x g) and decreases in renal vascular resistance. However, this dose still decreased urine flow and sodium excretion. In contrast, when candesartan was administered at 0.01 mg/kg, a dose that did not significantly decrease arterial pressure, there were significant increases in RBF (26+/-11%) and urine flow (43+/-19%) and proportionately greater increases in sodium excretion (284+/-89%) and fractional sodium excretion (351+/-99%). These data demonstrate the divergent renal hemodynamic and sodium excretory responses to AT1 receptor blockade in hypertensive rats, depending on the magnitude of decreases in arterial pressure. The lower candesartan dose, which did not cause hypotension, elicited substantial increases in RBF and proportionally much greater increases in sodium excretion, revealing the direct renal vasodilation and natriuretic effects of AT1 receptor blockade.
9929558	Expression of early hippocampal CA1 LTP does not lead to changes in AMPA-EPSC kinetics or sensitivity to cyclothiazide.	We have analysed whether the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons involves a change in the kinetics of (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (AMPA-EPSCs) or their susceptibility to the AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide. AMPA-EPSCs in the CA1 region were evoked by alternate stimulation of two independent Schaffer collateral-commissural inputs of slices of adult rat hippocampus. In the current-clamp mode a strong tetanus (100 Hz, 1 s) applied to one input (input I) induced stable LTP of AMPA-EPSCs in this input, while the control input (input II) remained unaffected. For neither input were EPSC rise time and decay kinetics significantly changed. The application of cyclothiazide prolonged the rise time and the decay time constants of the AMPA-EPSCs in both control and potentiated inputs to the same extent (Input I-rise time: 198+/-8%, decay: 148+/-12%; input II-rise time: 212+/-14%, decay: 144+/-19%; n=8). Furthermore, when present during tetanization cyclothiazide did not occlude LTP, suggesting that cyclothiazide and tetanic stimulation enhance AMPA-EPSCs via independent mechanisms. Our findings argue against changes in (de-)activation or desensitization of AMPA receptors as the molecular basis for the expression of LTP.
9990413	Pharmacology of adapalene.	Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a new drug proposed for the treatment of acne patients. Studies on the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of adapalene have shown that it is very active on cell and tissue proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, adapalene has anti-inflammatory potential as determined by its anti-AP1 activity. Adapalene interacts selectively with the nuclear receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma, and its activity on proliferation and differentiation can be blocked by a RAR beta-gamma antagonist. Because RAR beta is not expressed in human keratinocytes, the effect of adapalene on the major cell type of the epidermis is certainly mediated by its interaction with RAR gamma. The unique pharmacological properties of adapalene may explain why, when compared to tretinoin, it has an improved therapeutic ratio due to its better tolerance.
9990415	Adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream stimulate retinoic acid receptor mediated gene transcription without significant irritative effects in the skin of healthy human volunteers.	A randomized, investigator masked, intra individual comparative study was conducted in 30 healthy volunteers to compare the cutaneous effects of adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream with their respective vehicles, using tretinoin 0.05% cream (n = 21) or tretinoin 0.1% cream (n = 9) and a tretinoin cream vehicle (n = 30) as controls. The products were applied to hip/buttock skin for 4 days under occlusive conditions. Cytosolic retinoic acid binding protein-II (CRABP-II) mRNA levels were measured using the RT-PCR technique in punch biopsies taken from 10 subjects. Epidermal thickness was assessed using image analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from another 11 subjects. Erythema was assessed in all subjects both by a visual scoring system and by chromameter. Adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream produced similar significant increases in CRABP-II mRNA levels compared to their vehicles (P < 0.01). The two tretinoin formulations also resulted in similar significant increases in CRABP-II compared to the cream vehicle (P < 0.001). However, only the two tretinoin formulations resulted in an increase in epidermal thickness and only the tretinoin 0.1% cream resulted in significant erythema. Adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream induce RAR-mediated gene expression to a similar degree in this model, without the irritant effects of tretinoin.
